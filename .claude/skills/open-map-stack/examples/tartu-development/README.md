# Tartu Development Access & Education Proxy — worked example

A complete `openmapstack-project/v1` example for the scenario in
[issue #4](https://github.com/jaakla/openmapstack/issues/4):

> Find suitable development locations near main roads around Tartu with 25-minute
> walking access to municipal schools and kindergartens, and make an interactive map.

The requested walking criterion is explicitly represented as a **2,000 m
straight-line screening proxy**, not a pedestrian-network isochrone. The project
is therefore correctly reported as `warning`, with that methodological limit and
the education source's unstated reuse license surfaced in the validation report.

## What the corrected example demonstrates

- **Semantically authoritative education data.** Schools and kindergartens come
  from Tartu City Government ArcGIS Feature Services. Schools must satisfy
  `Omand=1`, exclude outside-city type `Liik=5`, and be active; kindergartens
  must satisfy `Liik=10` and be active. Missing ownership is never defaulted.
  The current snapshot contains 26 schools and 35 kindergartens.
- **Completeness-safe roads.** ETAK WFS filtering is performed server-side and
  paginated until `numberReturned == numberMatched` (1,444 official primary and
  secondary road segments across two pages).
- **Honest method semantics.** Metric operations use EPSG:3301. Education
  buffers and tier names say “2 km straight-line proxy”, and the derived columns
  are `straightline_time_school_min` / `straightline_time_kg_min` — no output
  claims a network walking time. Assumption A4 records that distances are
  measured from the nearest parcel *edge*, so a large parcel qualifies when any
  part of it is in range.
- **Two verified overrides, both hypothetical and both isolated.**
  `OVERRIDE-001` is a `modify_attribute` scenario that switches one kindergarten
  (`Ilmatsalu Lasteaed Lepatriinu`) to inactive; the pipeline verifies that the
  target exists and that the asserted prior value (`active = true`) matches the
  immutable source before applying it, rejects placeholder evidence, and reports
  the result per override. `OVERRIDE-002` adds a hypothetical connector road
  through a separate scenario table, and never leaks into the “Official National
  Highways (ETAK)” presentation layer. Neither override rewrites `data/source/`:
  the effective POI layer is written to `data/derived/education_pois.json` with
  an `override_id` and a distinct `map_class`, and both the web map and the QGIS
  project style that class separately.
- **One canonical implementation.** Both documented commands execute
  `pipeline.py`; the E2E wrapper cannot drift from the plain pipeline.
- **Validation/report parity.** All manifest-required and domain checks appear
  in `validation/latest-report.json`, warnings propagate to project status, and
  run IDs/hashes point to a real `runs/*.json` record. `manifest_graph_resolves`
  additionally proves every `processing.steps` input resolves to a source key or
  an earlier step's output, and every `outputs.*.generated_by` names a real step.
- **A reconfigurable view that cannot misrepresent the run.** `dashboard.html`
  organises the sidebar into three tabs (Analysis / Map / Provenance) of
  collapsible sections, gives every layer group an on/off control, and exposes
  the analysis parameters as live controls: minimum parcel area, highway
  distance, education threshold, land use, and one switch per scenario override.
  Every control re-applies the published rule to distances the pipeline already
  measured in EPSG:3301 — the browser never re-measures geometry — and the
  education-threshold control swaps in a precomputed buffer for the radius it
  selects rather than approximating one. The canonical control positions come
  from `presentation.controls` in `project.yaml`, and the moment any control
  leaves them the view labels itself *Reconfigured view — not the accepted run*
  and offers a reset. The `view_controls_match_pipeline` gate fails the run if
  those declared positions ever drift from the thresholds the pipeline ran.
- **A local-first edit mode.** The generated dashboard can select cadastral
  parcels and education facilities, record typed attribute corrections or hide
  operations with rationale/evidence, and draw point/line/polygon scenario,
  annotation, or AOI geometry. Draft operations are stored in browser local
  storage per project + base run, support undo/redo, render as distinct delta
  overlays, and export as `openmapstack-override-bundle/v1` JSON. Parcel hide,
  land-use, and area edits immediately re-apply the existing browser rules;
  facility edits and drawn geometry are explicitly labelled map-only until the
  canonical pipeline recomputes spatial measurements. No browser draft changes
  source files, project validation, or the accepted run.
- **QGIS as a first-class view.** `project.qgz` uses relative sources, explicit
  scenario styling, live basemaps, and static archive/source/style validation.
  Its layer tree is *generated from* `presentation.map.layer_groups` and
  `presentation.map.layers`, so the desktop project cannot reorganise what the
  manifest says the product contains: a group declared with no QGIS counterpart
  fails the run rather than shipping. The three suitability tiers are three
  layers filtered by OGR subsets, one per manifest group, mirroring the three
  toggles the dashboard offers. If PyQGIS is unavailable, runtime loading is
  reported as `not_testable`, never passed implicitly.
- **Two backgrounds, on purpose.** The dashboard loads CARTO Positron as a
  MapLibre vector style. QGIS cannot read one, and CARTO's raster XYZ
  equivalent now answers unauthenticated requests with an *API KEY REQUIRED*
  watermark, so `project.qgz` carries the Maa- ja Ruumiamet Baaskaart WMS —
  authoritative, key-free, and served natively in EPSG:3301 — with
  OpenStreetMap XYZ as the unchecked alternative.

## Current regenerated result

Both scenario overrides are in effect, so these numbers describe the scenario,
not present-day conditions (see warning `SCENARIO-001`):

- Tier 1 — road plus both municipal education proxies: **66 parcels / 849.1 ha**
- Tier 2 — road plus either municipal education proxy: **84 parcels / 2,468.3 ha**
- Tier 3 — road access only: **367 parcels / 6,249.4 ha**
- Total road-accessible candidates: **517 parcels / 9,566.9 ha**
- Candidates whose closest qualifying road is the hypothetical scenario: **59**
- Effective education layer: **27 schools + 34 kindergartens active**, 1 switched
  off by `OVERRIDE-001` (62 authoritative facilities in the immutable source)

Removing `OVERRIDE-001` moves 63 parcels back from Tier 2 to Tier 1
(129 / 3,181.2 ha), which is the point of the scenario: a single kindergarten
carries most of the western cluster's Tier 1 status. That comparison is a switch
in the dashboard's Map tab, because the pipeline exports
`dist_school_baseline_m` / `dist_kg_baseline_m` alongside the effective
distances — the same measurement, taken against the facility set as the
authoritative source publishes it.

## Run

```bash
python -m venv .e2e-venv
./.e2e-venv/bin/pip install duckdb pyyaml pyproj
cd examples/tartu-development
../../.e2e-venv/bin/python pipeline.py
```

The equivalent convenience command is:

```bash
../../.e2e-venv/bin/python run_e2e.py
```

`data/source/` is a cache, and it never expires on its own. A re-run reuses
whatever is there if the files are internally coherent — counts agreeing with
their recorded metadata, ownership and active-status predicates holding — which
establishes that the bytes are sound, not that they still match what the
services publish. Reuse older than seven days logs a warning naming the age.

**Before regenerating the committed artifacts, discard it:**

```bash
../../.e2e-venv/bin/python pipeline.py --refresh
```

Regenerating from a stale cache produces a project that looks fine and that CI
cannot reproduce, because CI always starts cold and fetches the current data.
That mismatch surfaces as the `project.qgz` currency failure in
`.github/workflows/example.yml`, a long way from its cause.

Outputs include:

- `data/source/Tartu_maakond_KATASTER_GPKG.gpkg` — 79,082 cadastral parcels
- `data/source/etak_main_roads.geojson` — completeness-verified ETAK main roads
- `data/source/tartu_municipal_education.geojson` — normalized official municipal facilities
- `data/derived/final-candidates.gpkg`, `.parquet`, `.json`
- `data/derived/education_catchments.json` — canonical 2 km straight-line proxy polygons (64 segments/quadrant)
- `data/derived/education_catchment_variants.json` — the same buffer rule at every
  radius the dashboard control offers (1–3 km), for the effective and the
  override-free facility sets; exploratory companion, never the accepted result
- `data/derived/education_pois.json` — effective facilities (source + overrides, `map_class` + `override_id`)
- `data/derived/main_roads.json` — official ETAK roads only
- `project.qgz`, `dashboard.html`, `validation/latest-report.json`, and `runs/*.json`

Set `OPENMAPSTACK_USE_QGIS_DOCKER=1` to request native project compilation with the
pinned QGIS container. The deterministic XML generator remains the fallback;
runtime layer validity is still reported separately. Both paths build the layer
tree from the same manifest-derived plan, so they cannot drift apart.

Re-running is not optional after editing `pipeline.py`: the run record hashes
the pipeline alongside the sources, and `openmapstack validate --preflight`
fails `runs.present_files` while the committed record describes a version of
the code that is no longer there.

## Checking it

```bash
openmapstack validate examples/tartu-development/project.yaml   # manifest + artifacts
openmapstack verify examples/tartu-development                  # oracle-free product QA
```

Both report `warning`, which is the honest status for this project: the
education source publishes no reuse license, and the 25-minute walking
criterion is met with a straight-line proxy rather than a pedestrian-network
isochrone. The QGIS checks need PyQGIS and report `not_testable` without it;
`.github/workflows/example.yml` regenerates the data and runs the full set.

## Editing project.yaml

`pipeline.py` rewrites `project.yaml` at the end of every run (`updated_at`,
per-source retrieval metadata, `runs.latest`) by dumping the parsed document,
which **discards YAML comments**. Prose that has to survive a run belongs in a
data field — `note`, `rationale`, `statement` — not in a `#` comment.
