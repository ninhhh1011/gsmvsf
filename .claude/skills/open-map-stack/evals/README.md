# OpenMapStack eval suite

Executable evals that check whether an agent-generated analysis (or a
hand-authored reference project) reaches the right analytical answer, respects
the GIS-method guardrails in `SKILL.md`, and reruns reproducibly — with the
`openmapstack-project/v1` contract in `references/project-spec.md` as the substrate
that makes all three independently checkable rather than a matter of trusting
the agent's narration.

> A model/agent should not pass because it says the right things. It passes
> when the produced project can be inspected, executed and independently
> checked.

## Execution modes and score types

Native skill discovery is a separate integration smoke path:
`python evals/run.py routing --list`. See [routing smoke tests](routing.md)
and the [frozen pre-refactor baselines](baselines/README.md). It does not inject
skill-reading instructions or contribute to project-quality pass rates.

Execution mode describes how a project is produced. `fixture` runs committed,
deterministic reference projects with no network or LLM calls. `live` starts in
an empty workspace, copies only explicitly declared input fixtures, invokes an
agent, and grades its output with the same semantic assertions. `visual`
executes the fixture generator in a richer validation environment (real PyQGIS
and a headless Chromium) and grades it under the separate `integration_visual`
score type.

```bash
python evals/run.py --mode fixture
```

Score type describes what the result means. The v2 result schema keeps four
denominators separate:

- `contract_ci`: positive reference-project conformance;
- `mutation_tests`: successful detection of deliberately defective projects;
- `agent_benchmark`: live agent task success;
- `integration_visual`: rendered QGIS/browser integration checks.

Cases 001–006 support both fixture and live execution (001 and 006 also run a
visual leg). Cases 901–911 and 914–922 are fixture-only mutations; cases 912
and 913 are visual-only mutations, proving that a dashboard which hides a
manifest warning and one that ships no background map each fail in a real
browser. Mutation detection is never included in contract or agent pass rates.

Every score type also publishes a `capability` block — assertions evaluated,
how many were `not_testable`, and how many soft gates went unmet — and the
runner says so on the same screen as the pass rate. A rate produced by an
environment that could not run the PyQGIS or browser assertions is not the
same evidence as one produced by an environment that could, and the numbers
must not read alike.

```bash
python3 evals/run.py --mode live \
  --agent claude_code \
  --model claude-sonnet-4-6 \
  --skill-mode enabled \
  --case 001-basic-spatial-analysis \
  --case 002-attribute-override \
  --case 004-data-quality-warning \
  --case 005-reproducible-rerun \
  --repetitions 3
```

The runner returns setup exit code `2` if no cases support the selected mode,
so an unsupported selection cannot publish a green `0/0` benchmark.

## Scenario generator for focused coverage (PR 8)

`evals/fixtures/reference_pipeline/gen_spatial.py` produces small, focused
projects for the failure modes the main mini-Tartu fixture does not exercise.
Each scenario's correct answer is independently hand-derivable from its tiny
synthetic input — the case YAMLs pin exact feature ids, counts, distances and
areas, so they are true oracles. Scenarios (with paired mutation break
modes):

- `boundary` — buffer selection where one parcel only *touches* the buffer
  boundary (intersects, not contains) and another is a donut whose hole must
  reduce its measured area (breaks: `contains-vs-intersects`, `hole-filled`);
- `join` — many-to-many spatial join where duplicated input identifiers must
  not inflate the pair set (break: `double-count`);
- `crs` — a road legitimately stored in EPSG:4326, reprojected before metric
  use; the output CRS metadata is cross-checked against real coordinates
  (break: `crs-metadata-mismatch`);
- `health` — invalid (bow tie) and null-geometry features excluded and
  reported, never silently repaired (break: `invalid-accepted`);
- `formats` — one result delivered as GeoPackage, GeoParquet and GeoJSON
  with format parity enforced (break: `format-drift`);
- `overrides` — an ordered two-stage override chain plus a conflicting
  override that must be rejected against the immutable source
  (breaks: `conflict-ignored`, `ordered-swapped`).

Scenario input files are checked in under
`evals/fixtures/spatial-scenarios/<scenario>/`, and the runner's automatic
byte-identity check verifies the generator copies them unmodified.

## Visual integration (PyQGIS + browser)

Fixture CI proves the deterministic contracts; it deliberately cannot prove
that the produced QGIS project actually renders or that the dashboard behaves
like the manifest claims. The `visual` mode covers exactly that gap in a
capable environment (weekly schedule + manual dispatch:
`.github/workflows/eval-visual.yml`, container `qgis/qgis:3.44-trixie` plus
Playwright Chromium):

- `qgis.runtime_load` — every layer loads valid under PyQGIS and the
  controlled-extent render succeeds; a blank render (missing layers,
  collapsed extent, displaced CRS) fails with `blank_render`;
- `qgis.layers_match_manifest` — every layer the manifest's
  `presentation.map.layers` claims is loaded with a resolvable CRS and the
  declared geometry family;
- `qgis.every_declared_layer_renders` — and every one of them actually
  *paints*. Loading valid is not the same as being visible: a layer can be
  buried under an opaque fill by layer-tree order, styled at zero opacity,
  or scale-limited out of the frame. Each declared layer is removed from an
  otherwise identical render and the result must differ, with the frame
  pinned to the full layer set and the basemap excluded so nothing else can
  move. This caught the reference project's POI markers being absent from
  every QGIS snapshot while the static, runtime and blank-render checks all
  passed;
- `qgis.styles_declared` / `qgis.groups_match_manifest` — static checks that
  every map layer declares a renderer and that the .qgz layer tree mirrors
  the manifest's layer groups (they run in fixture CI too);
- `visual.render_substantive` — a rendered snapshot must contain real drawn
  content (std-lib PNG analysis, no extra dependencies);
- `visual.dashboard_loads_in_browser` — the dashboard opens in headless
  Chromium with no page or console errors, the map/legend/provenance the
  manifest declares are actually visible, manifest warnings appear in the
  product, every layer-group toggle changes the rendered map, the scenario
  layer stays distinguishable from the authoritative baseline, the canonical
  reset restores control state, and desktop + mobile screenshots are kept.
- **Interactive basemap enforcement** — when the manifest declares
  `presentation.map.basemap` (OSM/Carto XYZ, regional WMS, ...), the product
  must actually render an interactive background map: a map canvas, real
  tile requests to the declared tile URL, and the basemap attribution
  visible in the UI (`basemap_absent` otherwise). This mirrors the skill's
  own rule that a regional tiled basemap is mandatory, and mutation case
  913 proves a basemap-less dashboard fails. The reference fixture ships a
  genuine MapLibre dashboard with an OSM raster basemap, and its `.qgz`
  carries the same XYZ basemap layer in a `basemap` tree group.

Visual checks supplement the numerical/structural assertions — every visual
leg also runs the full semantic assertion library against the generated
project — and never replace them.

Local run:

```bash
pip install -r evals/requirements.txt
pip install "playwright>=1.40" && python3 -m playwright install chromium
python3 evals/run.py --mode visual
```

An assertion whose dependency is missing reports `not_testable` — never a
silent pass. Assertions scoped `modes: [visual]` are hard gates, because
visual mode *is* the environment that has PyQGIS and a browser: soft-gating
them would mean a real regression in the integration container still
published a green run. So `--mode visual` needs both dependencies to pass,
and a run without them reports what it could not check rather than quietly
scoring less work as success.

Retained per-trial evidence lives under `evals/results/<run-id>/visual/
<case>/<trial>/`: `grading.json`, the generated project, the PyQGIS render,
and every dashboard screenshot.

## Running

```bash
python evals/run.py                        # every case, fixture mode
python evals/run.py --case attribute-override
python evals/run.py --mode fixture
python evals/run.py --json eval-results.json
python evals/run.py --mode live --agent codex --model <exact-model-id> --timeout 1200
python evals/run.py --mode live --agent openai_compatible --timeout 1200   # URL/key/model via OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_* env
python evals/run.py --repetitions 3 --seed 100
python evals/run.py --list
```

Fixture mode is the default, so an invocation without `--mode` never calls an
agent. `--timeout` applies to each generator or agent invocation;
`--repetitions` runs each selected case multiple times; and `--seed` records a
base seed that is incremented for each repetition.

Live mode requires an explicit `--model`: a run with an unknown CLI default is
not publishable benchmark evidence. The arm is explicit too: `--arms oms`
(the default; the controlled skill snapshot is injected), `--arms plain` (no
skill), or `--arms paired`, which runs both arms over identical cases, trials,
and seeds. `--skill-mode enabled|disabled` remains as an alias for the single
arms. Which arm ran is recorded per trial (`results[].arm`) and per arm in
`run_config.arm_provenance`.

### Arm provenance and paired comparison

Every live run records one `openmapstack-benchmark-arm/v1` record per arm
(`evals/schemas/benchmark-arm-v1.schema.json`): the skill snapshot content
hash and commit, a hash over the exact task set (expectations, prompts, and
declared fixtures), the checker package and check-API versions, the harness
commit, the runtime (Python, platform, DuckDB, container image), the adapter
and the exact agent version it drove, the model id and provider, the
sampling configuration the adapter reports, and `--price-catalog-date`. A
field the harness cannot learn is `null`, never omitted.

A paired run publishes `paired_arms`: per-arm success rate with a Wilson
interval, median cost, tokens, and duration, a `task_parity` flag proving
both arms saw the same case/trial/seed set, and trajectory diagnostics
(event counts) that are explicitly not correctness. There is no combined
"success per dollar" number; quality and cost are reported as a trade-off.
Paired bundles are retained under `evals/results/<run-id>/<agent>/<arm>/…`.

### Exporting tasks for OpenMapBench

```bash
python evals/run.py --export-tasks /tmp/openmapstack-tasks
python evals/run.py --export-tasks /tmp/tasks --case 070-underspecified-prompt
```

Each live-capable case becomes an `openmapstack-benchmark-task/v1` bundle:
prompt, declared fixtures (copied and hashed), assertion list, hard-gate
policy, and a task hash — never the reference project or the generator.
Cases 070–073 are marked `ownership: openmapbench`: they are the behavioural
prompt-style tasks whose canonical home is OpenMapBench; this repository
keeps them only as a scheduled smoke subset. See
`docs/openmapbench-interop.md` for the full contract.

`--case` is repeatable, and omitting it runs every case that declares live
mode (currently 001–006 and 070–073). The scheduled workflow omits it: a
hardcoded list there had pinned the run to 001/002/004/005 and silently left
the four prompt-style cases added by PR 8 executing in no workflow at all,
since they are live-only and fixture CI never touched them either. Use at
least three repetitions for routine runs and five for published comparisons.

## Auditable live benchmark bundles

Every retained live trial is written before its temporary workspace is removed:

```text
evals/results/<run-id>/<agent>/<case>/<trial>/
├── prompt.md
├── events.ndjson
├── stdout.txt
├── stderr.txt
├── agent.json
├── generated-project/
└── grading.json
```

`agent.json` uses the vendor-neutral `openmapstack-agent-run/v1` schema. It records
the actual adapter, resolved/requested model, exact installed CLI version,
permission policy, structured completion state, exit status, duration, token
usage, cost where the CLI exposes it, and the repository/skill revision. Raw
vendor events remain in `events.ndjson`; assistant final-answer prose is stored
for audit but never participates in grading. `grading.json` contains the same
deterministic assertion results used by fixture mode, and `generated-project/`
is copied before cleanup so every claim can be checked independently.

By default, live mode copies only `SKILL.md`, `references/`, and `templates/`
into an isolated `benchmark-context/` beside the empty project (the same
inspectable snapshot `openmapstack skill-snapshot` produces, with a
`snapshot.json` inventory), prepends an instruction to read that controlled
snapshot, and records its commit and content hash. Eval cases and expected projects are never exposed. Use
`--skill-mode disabled` for an explicit no-skill baseline; do not mix enabled
and disabled trials in one published denominator.

Use `--run-id` to assign a stable external run name and `--results-dir` to move
the bundle root. The runner refuses to overwrite an existing run directory.
`--no-retain-artifacts` exists only for deliberate adapter smoke tests.

The scheduled workflow runs a non-blocking matrix for all adapters and uploads
the complete bundles. Configure repository variables
`CLAUDE_BENCHMARK_MODEL` and `CODEX_BENCHMARK_MODEL` with exact model ids and
the matching API-key secrets. Claude API keys that require workspace scoping
also need the `ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE_ID` secret containing the `wrkspc_...` ID;
the workflow sends it as the `anthropic-workspace-id` request header. Manual
runs may select one adapter and override its model. The default is three
repetitions; publication runs should request five.

### OpenAI-compatible provider (OpenRouter, vLLM, ...)

The `openai_compatible` adapter runs live cases against any OpenAI-compatible
`/chat/completions` endpoint with no CLI install. It drives the model as an
autonomous agent via a tool-execution loop (`run_shell`, `write_file`,
`read_file`, `list_dir`) scoped to the trial workspace, so the same assertions
can grade an OpenRouter-hosted model exactly like a CLI agent.

All configuration is environment-based:

| Variable | Kind | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL` | env (URL) | API root, e.g. `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` |
| `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_MODEL` | env (model) | Default model id; `--model` overrides it |
| `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY` | secret | Bearer token; never recorded in bundles |

```bash
export OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
export OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_MODEL=vendor/model-id
export OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY=sk-or-...   # secret: keep out of shell history
python evals/run.py --mode live --agent openai_compatible --case 001-basic-spatial-analysis
```

In CI, set `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL` as a repository variable and
`OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY` as a secret; the model id comes from the
`OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BENCHMARK_MODEL` variable or the workflow input. The API
key is stripped from every persisted record — `agent.json`, `events.ndjson`,
and captured output only ever carry the endpoint URL and model id.

Exit codes and result states are deliberately distinct:

- `0`: every executed trial has `status: passed`;
- `1`: at least one trial has `status: assertions_failed`;
- `2`: malformed configuration, setup/runtime failure, or zero executed cases.

Generator timeouts/nonzero exits, failed agent invocations, missing agent CLIs,
and assertion implementation exceptions are setup failures. Assertions are not
graded after such a failure, so unrelated breakage cannot satisfy a negative
case that expects assertion status `failed`.

## How a case runs

For each case directory under `evals/cases/<id>/`:

1. Create an isolated temp workspace (`tempfile.mkdtemp`).
2. In fixture mode, copy the case's committed project into the workspace. In
   live mode, create an empty project and copy only `live.fixtures` to their
   declared destinations. Reference outputs are never exposed to the agent.
3. Run `fixture.generator`, or invoke the configured live `AgentAdapter` with
   `prompt.md`, then evaluate whatever project it produced.
   Mutation cases also run their explicit `mutation.control_generator` in a
   separate workspace. The one target assertion must pass on that healthy
   twin before the mutant is eligible for scoring.
4. Require every configured subprocess or agent invocation to succeed. A
   failure produces `setup_failed` and assertions are not scored.
5. Run every assertion listed in the case's `expected.yaml` against the
   resulting workspace, using the reusable checks in `openmapstack/checks/`.
6. Write a machine-readable v2 result with case type, execution mode, score
   type, trial, pass/fail per assertion, complete subprocess/agent diagnostics,
   run configuration, and environment metadata. Live mode first copies the
   prompt, raw events/streams, normalized agent record, generated project, and
   grading record into its retained per-trial artifact bundle.
7. Return `1` for required assertion failures or `2` for setup failures.

Mutation definitions must contain exactly one non-passing target assertion.
All other assertions are isolation guards and must pass on both the healthy
control and the mutant. An unhealthy control is `setup_failed`, excluded from
the mutation-score denominator, and reported as an invalid mutation. Results
publish detected, survived, invalid, and isolated counts plus an explicit
mutation score.

Assertions read real files: `project.yaml`, `validation/latest-report.json`,
`runs/*.json`, and the actual geodata outputs (via DuckDB Spatial). They do
not pattern-match assistant prose.

## Genuine clean reruns

A mode may declare `clean_rerun: {}`. The runner then creates a second empty
workspace and preserves only:

- `project.yaml`;
- `data/source/` and `data/overrides/`;
- the canonical `runtime.implementation.pipeline` or project-local files named
  by `runtime.implementation.command`;
- project-relative files listed in `runtime.implementation.dependencies`.

Derived outputs, reports, run records, caches, presentation artifacts, prompts,
and conversation-related environment variables are excluded. The runner invokes
the canonical entrypoint without a shell, performs full artifact validation,
and writes `.openmapstack-clean-rerun.json` as evidence. Project-caused rerun
failures are graded by `rerun.clean_execution_succeeded`; they are not
misclassified as eval setup failures.

`rerun.outputs_semantically_equal` ignores row/feature order and normalizes
GeoJSON geometry representation. Validation evidence ignores standard run IDs,
hashes, and timestamps while still requiring identical check results and
evidence. Additional nondeterministic output fields must be explicitly listed
with `ignored_fields`; they are never silently discarded.

A `clean_rerun` also recomputes real sha256 hashes of every file under the
rerun copy's `data/source/` and `data/overrides/` before and after the
canonical entrypoint runs. Any change fails the rerun at the
`source_integrity` stage — a pipeline cannot claim reproducibility while
mutating its own declared-immutable inputs.

## Source hashes and immutability

`fixture.source_baseline` and `live.fixtures` both declare the real,
checked-in file a case treats as ground truth. Before the generator or agent
runs, the runner hashes that origin file directly (never a declared/authored
hash) and makes the result available to assertions as the `$SOURCE_HASHES`
magic value for the `hashes_before` argument:

```yaml
fixture:
  generator: "{python} {evals_dir}/fixtures/reference_pipeline/gen.py {project_dir}"
  source_baseline:
    - { source: ../../fixtures/mini-tartu/pois.geojson, destination: data/source/pois.geojson }

assertions:
  - assert: overrides.source_files_byte_identical
    args: { hashes_before: "$SOURCE_HASHES", paths: [data/source/pois.geojson] }
```

`overrides.source_files_byte_identical` also accepts `rerun_workspace: "$RERUN"`
to compare a workspace's source files directly against a clean-rerun copy.
A missing/empty baseline, or a baseline missing a requested path, is reported
`not_testable` — it can never be silently treated as "no mismatch found".

`openmapstack.validation` independently requires every declared output to exist
and to appear, correctly hashed, in the run record's output inventory
(`runs.latest` fails otherwise), and reports any file under `data/derived/`
that is not a declared output as `outputs.undeclared_derived_files` (`warning`
by policy, never a silent pass).

The check library itself is **not** here. It lives in the shipped package,
because `openmapstack verify` grades a user's own project with the very same
functions this suite grades eval cases with:

```text
openmapstack/checks/        # reusable, semantic checks (importable, shipped)
├── project.py              # schema, graph resolution, status/report agreement

└── spatial.py              # controlled, load-only DuckDB Spatial access
```

All but five of these checks are oracle-free — they hold for any correct
project on any data, which is what lets them transfer to data this repository
has never seen. Optional dependencies are declared as package extras
(`openmapstack[geo]` for DuckDB, `[visual]` for Playwright; PyQGIS is a system
install), and a check whose dependency is absent reports `not_testable`.

```

Generator commands expand four placeholders before execution:

| Placeholder     | Expands to                                                        |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `{python}`      | `sys.executable` — the interpreter running `evals/run.py`         |
| `{repo_root}`   | Repository root                                                    |
| `{evals_dir}`   | The `evals/` directory                                             |
| `{project_dir}` | The case's project directory inside the temporary workspace        |

Always write `{python}`, never a bare `python3`. A hardcoded `python3` resolves
against `PATH` rather than the active interpreter, so it escapes a virtualenv
(the generators then fail on a missing `duckdb`), and it does not exist on a
stock Windows install.

Each `assert` name maps to a Python function `openmapstack/checks/<module>.<fn>`
taking `(workspace: Path, **args) -> AssertionResult`. `AssertionResult` is
`{status: passed|failed|warning|not_testable, detail: str}` — the same
four-state vocabulary the project spec itself requires, so an eval can never
silently treat "could not check" as a pass.

Case definitions are validated before execution. `score_types` keys must
exactly match `modes`; mode-specific settings live under `fixture` and `live`.
Unknown modes, case/score types, agents, or assertions; invalid expectation
states; unsafe workspace paths; escaped fixture sources; and malformed
generator declarations are setup errors rather than benchmark results.

The structural contracts are published as
`evals/schemas/case-v2.schema.json` and
`evals/schemas/results-v2.schema.json`; cases and emitted summaries are
validated before use. `{python}` in a generator command resolves to the
interpreter running `evals/run.py`, avoiding dependency drift between an
active virtual environment and another `python3` on `PATH`.

Produced manifests are validated by `project.conforms_to_schema` against the
packaged `openmapstack/schemas/project-v1.schema.json`. Checking only the value of
the manifest's `schema:` field is not sufficient.

## Adding a regression eval

Whenever a GIS-correctness or reproducibility bug is fixed in this repo or a
generated project, add a minimal case here that would have caught it:

1. Create `evals/cases/<NNN>-<short-name>/`.
2. Add the smallest fixture/reference project that reproduces the bug.
3. Write `expected.yaml` asserting the specific invariant that was violated
   (not a specific implementation).
4. Confirm the case fails against the buggy state and passes once fixed.
5. Add it to the negative-case list below if it demonstrates a
   plausible-but-wrong workflow the suite must keep rejecting.

### Promoting a live failure into a mutation

The mutation set has a structural blind spot: every break mode is one this
repository already thought of and taught `gen.py --break=` to inject. It
cannot contain a defect nobody imagined. Live agents produce exactly those.

So when a live trial — here or in OpenMapBench — yields a *plausible but
wrong* project that the suite graded as passing, that is not merely a bad
trial. It is a hole in the graders, and it gets closed the same way every
other one does:

1. Keep the trial's retained bundle; `generated-project/` is the evidence.
2. Name the defect in one line: what is wrong with the artifact, not what the
   agent said. If that cannot be written down, the case is not ready.
3. Add the narrowest `--break=<mode>` to `gen.py` or `gen_spatial.py` that
   reproduces it from the healthy reference project.
4. Add a paired mutation case with exactly one non-passing target assertion
   and a pinned `expect_code`. If no existing assertion catches it, the
   assertion is the actual deliverable — write that first.
5. Confirm the healthy control still passes every assertion, so the case
   scores as a detected mutation rather than an invalid one.

A defect found by a live model and left only in a results bundle will be
found again by the next model. In a mutation case it is found once.

## CI

`python evals/run.py --mode fixture` requires no LLM account and is safe to
run on every PR. Grading and generated pipelines call only `LOAD spatial`;
they never execute `INSTALL` or silently fall back to a network download.
`python evals/prepare_spatial.py` is the sole explicit preparation path and
installs into `OPENMAPSTACK_SPATIAL_EXTENSION_DIR` when configured. CI builds
`evals/Dockerfile.offline`, prepares Spatial while the image is built, and
then runs the complete unit and fixture suite with `docker run --network none`.
Any hidden extension download or mutable service call therefore fails the
offline acceptance gate. Live agent cases (`--mode live`)
are intended for a separate manual/scheduled workflow with maintainer-owned
secrets; they must never block ordinary PRs when a third-party model or data
endpoint is unavailable. The scheduled workflow installs and verifies the
selected agent CLI before invoking the benchmark; its job remains non-blocking,
but the uploaded JSON preserves setup failures instead of treating them as
passes. The visual integration (`.github/workflows/eval-visual.yml`) is
likewise scheduled/manual only: it runs `--mode visual` inside the
`qgis/qgis:3.44-trixie` container with Playwright Chromium and uploads the
rendered snapshots as evidence.

## Result dimensions

`run.py --json` reports pass/fail per assertion and rolls dimensions up within
each score type: GIS correctness, project/reproducibility compliance,
provenance, override handling, validation integrity, presentation contract,
rerun success, metamorphic evidence, and visual judgement. The buckets are
owned by `openmapstack.api.DIMENSIONS` and stay separate: a metamorphic
relation that holds is self-consistency, not a correct answer, and a visual
judgement never stands in for an analytical one. Setup failures are reported but excluded from pass-rate
denominators. There is intentionally no aggregate `16/16` score: a detected
mutation, a conforming fixture, and a successful agent trial answer different
questions.

CI also publishes `assertion-coverage.json` and `assertion-coverage.xml` from
branch coverage over the complete `openmapstack/checks/` package. The current
gate is 70%; the report includes PyQGIS integration paths that are intentionally
unavailable in the ordinary Python job, so the actual percentage remains
visible rather than omitting those modules. Direct tests cover every public
assertion, including positive/negative and unavailable-dependency behavior
where applicable.

## Canonical run hashes and evidence

Every run record contains explicit `inputs` and `outputs` inventories. Each
entry carries a project-relative `path` and the real file SHA-256. The
aggregate is recomputed over the inventory sorted by path; for every file the
digest consumes an eight-byte big-endian path length, the UTF-8 path, then the
file bytes. All source/override/implementation inputs and every declared
output must participate. Missing files, stale per-file hashes, omitted files,
malformed hashes, and mutually matching but invented aggregates fail.

Source baselines are runner-owned hard gates. When fixture or live inputs have
a pre-execution baseline, `run.py` injects byte-identity validation even if a
case author omitted it and requires the baseline to cover the complete
`data/source/` and `data/overrides/` trees.

`validation.report_evidence_recomputes` independently derives supported row,
geometry-validity, duplicate-ID, and null-ID counters from actual geodata.
`geodata.dataset_crs_is` reads real dataset CRS metadata rather than trusting
the manifest.
