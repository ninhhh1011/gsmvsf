"""Sampled ("nail it before you scale it") runs, and why they can never be canonical.

A wide-area, high-resolution analysis can run for hours before a late step
fails. A sampled run executes the *same* pipeline over a deliberately smaller
slice so that failure arrives in minutes instead.

What a sampled run proves and does not prove
--------------------------------------------
It proves the pipeline *executes*: the manifest graph resolves, the sources are
reachable, CRS handling holds, schemas line up, pagination works within the
slice. It does **not** prove the numbers. Clipping to a test AOI breaks every
neighbourhood operation at the cut, row sampling destroys the spatial coherence
a join depends on, and raster downsampling changes areas and slopes
non-linearly. So a sampled run's outputs are never an answer.

How that is enforced
--------------------
Structurally, not by convention:

- a sampled run legitimately produces a different ``inputs_hash`` -- clipped
  inputs are different bytes -- so it cannot share the canonical hash chain;
- its run record carries ``mode: sampled`` plus the **realized** sample, not
  merely the requested one (``TABLESAMPLE`` and friends only approximate);
- ``runs.latest`` may never point at a sampled record, so ``verify``, the
  clean-rerun protocol, and ``validation.expectations`` attestations -- which
  bind to ``runs.latest.inputs_hash`` -- cannot inherit a sampled baseline;
- ``openmapstack run --sample*`` re-inspects the tree afterwards and fails
  loudly if the pipeline promoted itself into ``runs.latest`` -- by moving the
  pointer, by rewriting or deleting the record that pointer already resolves
  to, or by writing no sampled record at all.

If a sampled run overwrites or removes the declared outputs, the existing
``outputs_hash`` machinery already refuses to call the project validated: the
files no longer hash to what the canonical run recorded. The CLI reports that
clobber explicitly so the later failure is not a surprise.

Choosing a *representative* sample is judgment, not arithmetic -- a naive
sub-bbox of a global dataset lands in open ocean -- so this module never picks
one. It binds the value the manifest or the operator supplied.
