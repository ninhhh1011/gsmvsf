"""Reusable, semantic checks over an `openmapstack-project/v1` artifact.

Every check has the signature:

    def fn(workspace: Path, **args) -> AssertionResult

and inspects real files in `workspace` (a project directory) rather than
assistant prose. Checks never raise for expected "could not check"
conditions — they return `not_testable` instead, matching the four-state
vocabulary (`passed | failed | warning | not_testable`) required of
`validation/latest-report.json` itself in `references/project-spec.md`
section 6.

Two callers share this library, deliberately:

- `evals/run.py` grades eval cases with it (`contract_ci`, `mutation_tests`,
  `agent_benchmark`, `integration_visual`);
- `openmapstack verify` grades a *user's own* project with it.

That is the point of it living in the shipped package rather than under
`evals/`. All but a handful of these checks are oracle-free: they hold for
any correct project on any data, so they transfer to data this repository
has never seen. The exceptions — the ones that need a known answer — are
`geodata.row_count(equals=)`, `feature_present`, `feature_absent`,
`feature_field_equals`, and `field_range`. On user data those are reachable
only through allowlisted, input-bound `validation.expectations` attestations,
never from an answer the pipeline computed and certified for itself.
