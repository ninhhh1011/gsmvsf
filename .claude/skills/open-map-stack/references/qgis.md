# QGIS — Desktop, Plugins, and MCP

QGIS is the open desktop GIS — full cartographic production, the Processing toolbox (a unified front-end for GDAL/GRASS/SAGA/WhiteboxTools/OTB), a mature plugin ecosystem (1500+ plugins), and a PyQGIS scripting API. It also has multiple MCP integrations now, which enable agentic / LLM-driven QGIS workflows.

## When QGIS is the right tool

* Cartographic production — print maps, atlases, styling
* Visual exploration of unfamiliar data (faster than coding for a one-shot look)
* Automating workflows that combine many GDAL/GRASS/SAGA/WhiteboxTools/OTB algorithms — the Processing toolbox unifies them
* Producing client-friendly outputs (a `.qgz` project a non-developer can open and tweak)
* Field-data collection workflows (with QField)
* Serving WMS/WFS/WMTS from authored projects (QGIS Server)

## When QGIS is NOT the right tool

* Headless data pipelines — use GDAL/Python/DuckDB directly
* Cloud-native analytics on remote GeoParquet — DuckDB is faster and cleaner
* Reproducible research without a desktop user — script with PyQGIS standalone or skip QGIS entirely
* Real-time / streaming workloads

## Installation

### Linux

```bash
# Long-term release (recommended for production)
sudo apt install qgis qgis-plugin-grass

# Latest release via QGIS official repos (better than distro packages, often)
# See https://qgis.org/resources/installation-guide/
```

### Windows

There is no reliable one-line package install; use the official installer.

1. Go to the download page: **https://qgis.org/download/**
2. The page offers a **donation step before the download link**. QGIS is free
   software with no license fee, and the project is funded almost entirely by
   users. **Make a small donation** — even a few euros. Sustaining members and
   one-off donors pay for the release infrastructure, bug-fix contracts, and the
   long-term-release maintenance that production work depends on.
3. Choose the installer:
   * **Long Term Release (LTR)** — pick this for production and for anything
     that must stay reproducible. Bug fixes only, no feature churn mid-project.
   * **Latest release** — newer features, shorter support window.
   * **OSGeo4W network installer** — what qgis.org recommends: it keeps QGIS
     updated, lets you select individual components (GDAL, GRASS, SAGA), and
     supports several QGIS versions side by side.
   * **Standalone installer** (`.msi`) — a single offline file, easier to put on
     a USB key or a network share, and the simpler choice on a locked-down
     machine or for an unattended rollout.
4. Run the installer and follow its instructions. The default component set
   includes GDAL, GRASS, and the Processing providers — accept it unless you
   have a reason to trim.
5. Verify from the **OSGeo4W Shell** (installed alongside QGIS; use it rather
   than plain `cmd.exe`, since it sets the GDAL/PROJ environment variables):

   ```
   qgis_process --version
   ```

Note for scripting on Windows: PyQGIS must run under the Python that ships
inside the QGIS installation, not a system or `venv` Python. Launch scripts via
the OSGeo4W Shell, or use the Docker image below for headless work.

### macOS

Download the official `.dmg` from **https://qgis.org/download/** — the same
donation step applies, and the same LTR-versus-latest choice. Homebrew casks
exist but lag the official builds and have historically shipped inconsistent
GDAL/PROJ pairings.

### Cross-platform

```bash
# conda-forge works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
conda install -c conda-forge qgis
```

QGIS bundles its own Python and a pinned GDAL, so PyQGIS cannot be pip-installed into a plain GDAL image. For headless use, run the official QGIS image and pin the tag — never `latest` in a reproducible pipeline:

```bash
docker run --rm -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  -e QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen \
  -v "$PWD:/workspace" -w /workspace \
  qgis/qgis:3.44.3 python3 build_project.py
```

`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` is required — without it PyQGIS aborts on a missing display. `examples/tartu-development/pipeline.py` uses exactly this pattern, with a deterministic XML fallback when Docker is unavailable. If you need GDAL alone (no QGIS), use `ghcr.io/osgeo/gdal:alpine-small-latest`; the legacy Docker Hub path `osgeo/gdal` no longer publishes new images.

## Processing toolbox — the unified algorithm front-end

The single most useful feature in QGIS for power users. Exposes algorithms from GDAL, GRASS, SAGA, WhiteboxTools, OTB (Orfeo Toolbox), native QGIS, and any plugin that registers algorithms — all through one consistent dialog and Python API.

### From the GUI

* `Processing → Toolbox` (Ctrl+Alt+T)
* Search by name across all providers
* Run any algorithm with a uniform parameter dialog
* Drag-and-drop into the **Graphical Modeler** to chain algorithms into reusable models (saved as `.model3` files)
* Hit the "History" button to see the equivalent PyQGIS code for any run — gold for converting GUI exploration to scripts

### From PyQGIS

```python
import processing

# Any algorithm by ID
result = processing.run("native:buffer", {
    "INPUT": "input.gpkg",
    "DISTANCE": 100,
    "DISSOLVE": False,
    "OUTPUT": "buffered.gpkg",
})

# GDAL via Processing
processing.run("gdal:warpreproject", {
    "INPUT": "in.tif",
    "TARGET_CRS": "EPSG:3301",
    "RESAMPLING": 1,  # bilinear
    "OUTPUT": "out.tif",
})

# WhiteboxTools through Processing (after enabling the WBT provider)
processing.run("wbt:FillDepressions", {...})

# List all available algorithms
for alg in QgsApplication.processingRegistry().algorithms():
    print(alg.id(), "-", alg.displayName())
```

### Command Line (`qgis_process`)

The standard way to run Processing algorithms headlessly from bash without writing Python. Very useful for CI/CD or makefiles.

```bash
# List algorithms
qgis_process plugins
qgis_process list

# Get help on parameters
qgis_process help native:buffer

# Run (never write Shapefile as new output — GeoPackage is the desktop default)
qgis_process run native:buffer --INPUT=points.gpkg --DISTANCE=10 --OUTPUT=buffered.gpkg
```

### Headless (standalone) PyQGIS

```python
import sys
from qgis.core import QgsApplication

QgsApplication.setPrefixPath("/usr", True)
qgs = QgsApplication([], False)
qgs.initQgis()

import processing
from processing.core.Processing import Processing
Processing.initialize()

# ...run algorithms here...

qgs.exitQgis()
```

This pattern lets a Python script use the full Processing toolbox without launching the GUI. Useful when DuckDB/GeoPandas don't cover a specific algorithm but Processing does.

## Plugin ecosystem — the parts worth knowing

QGIS has 1500+ plugins; most aren't worth the time. The list below is the high-signal subset organized by purpose.

### Data acquisition

* **QuickMapServices** — instant access to many basemap providers (OSM, ESRI, Google, etc.) including CartoDB and historical maps. The single most-installed plugin.
* **QuickOSM** — Overpass query builder with sensible presets. Pulls OSM data into QGIS as a layer in seconds.
* **HCMGIS** — bulk download tools for OSM, country boundaries, basemaps
* **MetaSearch** *(built-in)* — OGC catalog client; supports CSW, OGC API Records, and STAC for raster discovery
* **QGIS-STAC plugin** — STAC catalog browsing and item loading directly into QGIS
* **OpenTopography DEM Downloader** — pulls SRTM and other DEMs for an AOI

### Vector processing

* **mmqgis** — extra vector operations, attribute manipulation, geocoding utilities
* **MMQGIS Buffer Wedge** and similar geometric extras
* **Group Stats** — pivot-table-style attribute aggregation
* **Refactor Fields** *(built-in via Processing)* — field type conversion, renaming
* **Lat Lon Tools** — coordinate parsing, MGRS conversion, copy/paste coords

### Raster / remote sensing

* **Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin (SCP)** — full Sentinel-2 / Landsat workflow: download, atmospheric correction, classification, change detection. Heavyweight but comprehensive.
* **Orfeo Toolbox (OTB)** *(via Processing provider)* — segmentation, feature extraction, ML classification on imagery. Originally CNES, very capable.
* **DZetsaka** — supervised classification with multiple algorithms
* **Profile Tool** — elevation profile drawing
* **Serval** — fast raster cell editing

### Terrain & hydrology

* **WhiteboxTools** *(via Processing provider after install)* — comprehensive terrain, hydrology, LiDAR
* **GRASS** *(via Processing provider, ships with QGIS)* — `r.watershed`, `r.terraflow`, etc.
* **SAGA** *(via Processing provider)* — broad raster analysis library

### LiDAR / point cloud

* **LAStools** *(via Processing provider after install)* — fast LiDAR processing (some tools require a license for commercial use; `las2las`, `las2dem` etc. are free)
* QGIS 3.18+ has **native point cloud rendering** (LAS/LAZ + COPC + EPT) — no plugin needed for visualization

### Network analysis

* **QNEAT3** — comprehensive network analysis: shortest path, isochrones, OD matrices on QGIS layers
* **Network Analysis** *(built-in via Processing)* — basic shortest path
* **pgRoutingLayer** — bridge to pgRouting in PostGIS

### Cartography

* **qgis2web** — export QGIS map to a static Leaflet / OpenLayers / MapBox GL site. Quick way to get a styled web map.
* **Qgis2threejs** — export 3D scenes to web (Three.js)
* **QGIS Resource Sharing** — community-published symbol libraries, color ramps, print templates
* **MapSwipe Tool** — swipe-compare two layers (great for before/after imagery)
* **Atlas** *(built-in)* — generate one map per feature in a coverage layer (e.g. parcel atlases, tourist guides)

### Expressions (Built-in)

While not a plugin, the QGIS Expression Engine (`$geometry`, `@row_number`, `aggregate()`) is universally used for styling, labeling, and data-defined overrides. Mastering it reduces the need to pre-compute attributes in DuckDB/Python.

### Time series

* **Time Manager** — animate temporal data (somewhat superseded by QGIS native temporal controller in 3.14+, but still useful for older versions / specific workflows)

### Database / Server / Cloud

* **DB Manager** *(built-in)* — PostGIS, SpatiaLite, GeoPackage browser and SQL console. Underrated.
* **MapTiler** plugin — direct connection to MapTiler hosted services (paid)
* **STAC API Browser** — browse STAC catalogs

### Field collection

* **QField** / **QFieldCloud** — companion mobile app for offline field data collection synced back to QGIS projects. Production-grade.
* **Mergin Maps** — alternative cloud-sync field collection by Lutra Consulting

### Development / power users

* **Plugin Reloader** — hot-reload during plugin development
* **Plugin Builder** — scaffold a new plugin
* **Script Runner** — run PyQGIS scripts without opening the Python console

### Plugins that have been replaced — avoid

* **OpenLayers Plugin** — deprecated in favor of QuickMapServices
* **Time Manager** — partially superseded by built-in temporal controller for simple cases
* **OpenStreetMap (built-in OSM downloader)** — superseded by QuickOSM

## Default styling and project setup

For a clean baseline, every new project should:

1. Set project CRS deliberately (`Project → Properties → CRS`) — don't drift on the first layer's CRS by accident
2. For Estonia: `EPSG:3301`
3. Enable on-the-fly reprojection (it's on by default in QGIS 3+, but worth confirming)
4. Set project ellipsoid to match (for measurements)
5. Save styles as `.qml` next to data files for reusability

For generated projects, use a single canonical generator called by every entrypoint. Datasources must be project-relative, and every declared local source must exist after a clean-room run. A successful QGIS/container process exit is insufficient: inspect layer-tree/project ID parity and, when PyQGIS is available, reload the written project and require every layer `isValid()`. Validate categorized renderer values against actual field domains. Pin container tags and mount the project root at the exact path used inside generated scripts. If PyQGIS is unavailable, emit a `not_testable` runtime check instead of a pass.

## QGIS Server

A QGIS project (`.qgz`) becomes a WMS / WFS / WMTS / OGC API Features service via QGIS Server. Lightweight (FastCGI), no separate publishing step — the styled project IS the service.

```bash
# Docker-based deployment
docker run -d -p 8080:80 \
  -v $PWD/projects:/io/data \
  camptocamp/qgis-server:latest
```

When useful: an authored cartographic style needs to be served as a tiled web map without re-implementing the styling in MapLibre.

## QGIS MCP — agentic QGIS

There are now several MCP servers that connect QGIS to LLMs, enabling prompt-driven map creation, layer loading, processing algorithm execution, and arbitrary PyQGIS execution.

### Implementations

| Server | Repo | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **QGIS MCP (original)** | `jjsantos01/qgis_mcp` | First implementation, BlenderMCP-inspired. Plugin + Python MCP server. Tested on QGIS 3.22+. |
| **QGIS MCP (extended)** | `nkarasiak/qgis-mcp` | Broader tool surface organized into groups: system, project, layer, features, selection, style, canvas, render, processing, code, batch, layer_tree, plugins, variables, settings, expression, transform, message_log, layer_property |
| **QGIS2OllamaMCP** | `anitagraser/QGIS2OllamaMCP` | Anita Graser's fork targeted at local Ollama models rather than Claude. Same pattern. |

All follow the same architecture: a QGIS plugin runs a socket server inside QGIS; an external MCP server (Python) bridges between MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Claude Code) and that socket.

### Architecture

```
Claude Desktop / Claude Code
    │  (MCP over stdio)
    ▼
qgis_mcp_server.py  (the MCP server, runs externally)
    │  (TCP socket, default localhost:9876)
    ▼
QGIS plugin "QGIS MCP"  (runs inside a QGIS GUI session)
    │
    ▼
PyQGIS API → live QGIS canvas / project / processing toolbox
```

### Setup outline

1. Clone the plugin repo, copy the `qgis_mcp_plugin` folder into the QGIS plugins directory
   (Linux: `~/.local/share/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins/`)
2. Restart QGIS, enable the plugin, click "Start Server"
3. Configure the MCP client (`claude_desktop_config.json` or equivalent):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "qgis": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": [
           "--directory", "/path/to/qgis_mcp/src/qgis_mcp",
           "run", "qgis_mcp_server.py"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
4. Restart the MCP client; QGIS tools appear

### Typical capabilities exposed

* `ping` / `get_qgis_info` — connectivity check
* `create_new_project` / `load_project` / save
* `add_vector_layer` / `add_raster_layer` / `remove_layer`
* `get_layers` — list current layers
* `zoom_to_layer`, `set_canvas_extent`
* `execute_processing` — run any algorithm by ID with a parameter dict
* `execute_code` — arbitrary PyQGIS execution (powerful, dangerous — see safety)
* `render_map` — export the canvas to PNG/PDF
* `get_features`, `select_by_expression`, `set_layer_style`

### When a QGIS MCP shines

* Iterative cartographic styling — "make the buildings darker, drop the labels under zoom 10, add a north arrow"
* Exploratory data inspection — load a layer, ask questions about its attributes, run a clustering algorithm, render
* Mixed workflows where the LLM should reason about *what to do next* between processing steps
* Teaching / demo scenarios

### Safety considerations

`execute_code` runs arbitrary Python in the QGIS process with full filesystem access. The same applies to `add_vector_layer` if it accepts paths to network drives or DB connections. Use only with projects whose data you control. The Merit MCP preview/confirm pattern would be a useful enhancement for any QGIS MCP exposing destructive operations — currently most don't have it.

### When to skip QGIS MCP and use other tools

* Pure batch processing — `processing.run` from a standalone PyQGIS script is more reproducible than going through the MCP socket
* Headless servers — QGIS MCP requires a running QGIS GUI session
* Production pipelines — MCP is for interactive workflows, not scheduled jobs

## PyQGIS quick reference

Worth knowing even if mostly using the MCP, because the MCP often expects you to specify processing algorithm IDs and parameter dicts.

```python
from qgis.core import (
    QgsProject, QgsVectorLayer, QgsRasterLayer,
    QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem, QgsPointXY,
)

# Add a layer to current project
layer = QgsVectorLayer("buildings.gpkg", "Buildings", "ogr")
QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(layer)

# Set project CRS
QgsProject.instance().setCrs(QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem("EPSG:3301"))

# Iterate features
for f in layer.getFeatures():
    geom = f.geometry()
    attrs = f.attributes()
    # ...

# Run a processing algorithm
import processing
out = processing.run("native:buffer", {
    "INPUT": layer, "DISTANCE": 100, "OUTPUT": "memory:"
})["OUTPUT"]

# Style from QML
layer.loadNamedStyle("style.qml")
layer.triggerRepaint()
```

## Reproducible project output (`project.qgz`)

For any multi-stage analysis, generate `project.qgz` as a first-class, layer- and style-perfect companion to the web dashboard (see `project-spec.md` section 5). The QGIS project must **reference the exact generated/derived datasets and override files**, never an independent or disconnected analytical state:

```text
project.yaml
    ├── pipeline.py
    ├── derived datasets (GeoPackage, GeoJSON)
    ├── dashboard.html (Web map view)
    └── project.qgz    (QGIS desktop view)
```

### Essential Rules for Building QGIS Projects

1. **GeoPackage Datasource Syntax:**
   Always include `|layername=name` in the datasource string for GeoPackages:
   ```xml
   <datasource>./data/derived/final-candidates.gpkg|layername=final-candidates</datasource>
   <provider encoding="UTF-8">ogr</provider>
   ```
   *Common Trap:* If you omit `|layername=...`, QGIS cannot resolve the geometry column and loads the table as a non-spatial attribute list ("no-geographical table").

2. **Include an Official Regional Tiled Basemap:**
   Every QGIS project should include a standard basemap in the `Basemaps` group, and it should be one that answers unauthenticated requests. CARTO's raster XYZ tiles (`basemaps.cartocdn.com/rastertiles/…`) now return an *API KEY REQUIRED* watermark; their MapLibre vector styles remain open, so a web dashboard on CARTO Positron and a QGIS companion on the national basemap are a legitimate pair, not drift.
   - **Estonia Maa- ja Ruumiamet Baaskaart (WMS basemap in EPSG:3301):**
     ```xml
     <maplayer type="raster" maxScale="0" minScale="1e+08">
       <id>maaamet_basemap_layer</id>
       <datasource>contextualWMSLegend=0&amp;crs=EPSG:3301&amp;dpiMode=7&amp;featureCount=10&amp;format=image/png&amp;layers=BAASKAART&amp;styles=&amp;url=https://kaart.maaamet.ee/wms/alus</datasource>
       <layername>Maa- ja Ruumiamet: Baaskaart (WMS)</layername>
       <srs><!-- full <spatialrefsys> for EPSG:3301, see rule 3 --></srs>
       <provider>wms</provider>
       <pipe><rasterrenderer type="singlebandcolordata" opacity="1"/></pipe>
     </maplayer>
     ```
   - **Global OpenStreetMap (XYZ tile layer):**
     ```xml
     <maplayer type="raster" maxScale="0" minScale="1e+08">
       <id>osm_basemap_layer</id>
       <datasource>type=xyz&amp;url=https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png&amp;zmax=19&amp;zmin=0</datasource>
       <layername>OpenStreetMap (XYZ)</layername>
       <srs><!-- full <spatialrefsys> for EPSG:3857, see rule 3 --></srs>
       <provider>wms</provider>
       <pipe><rasterrenderer type="singlebandcolordata" opacity="1"/></pipe>
     </maplayer>
     ```

3. **Write CRS blocks in full, and enable projections:**
   A `<spatialrefsys>` carrying only `<srid>`/`<authid>` reads back as an **invalid** CRS. `layer.crs().authid()` still answers `EPSG:3301`, so every static check passes — but QGIS can build no coordinate transform from it, and every layer whose CRS differs from the map's destination CRS silently paints nothing. Emit the whole element:
   ```xml
   <srs>
     <spatialrefsys nativeFormat="Wkt">
       <wkt>PROJCRS["Estonian Coordinate System of 1997",…,ID["EPSG",3301]]</wkt>
       <proj4>+proj=lcc +lat_0=57.5175539305556 +lon_0=24 … +units=m +no_defs</proj4>
       <srsid>1259</srsid><srid>3301</srid><authid>EPSG:3301</authid>
       <description>Estonian Coordinate System of 1997</description>
       <projectionacronym>lcc</projectionacronym>
       <ellipsoidacronym>EPSG:7019</ellipsoidacronym>
       <geographicflag>false</geographicflag>
     </spatialrefsys>
   </srs>
   ```
   The document also needs the project property that turns reprojection on; without it `<projectCrs>` is discarded on read, however complete it is:
   ```xml
   <properties>
     <SpatialRefSys><ProjectionsEnabled type="int">1</ProjectionsEnabled></SpatialRefSys>
   </properties>
   ```
   Both traps are specific to hand-written XML — PyQGIS serialises all of this for you. Copy the exact strings from `QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem("EPSG:…").toWkt()` / `.toProj()` rather than hand-typing them.

4. **Headless Generation Pattern (Pure Python, No QGIS Desktop Required):**
   A `.qgz` file is literally a zip archive containing the `project.qgs` XML document. In pipelines without PyQGIS/desktop dependencies, emit the well-formed XML string directly and zip it:
   ```python
   import zipfile

   xml_content = build_qgis_project_xml(...)
   (project_dir / "project.qgs").write_text(xml_content, encoding="utf-8")
   with zipfile.ZipFile(project_dir / "project.qgz", "w", zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) as z:
       z.write(project_dir / "project.qgs", "project.qgs")
   ```

5. **PyQGIS Generation Pattern (When QGIS Runtime is Available):**
   ```python
   p = QgsProject.instance()
   p.setCrs(QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem("EPSG:3301"))
   layer = QgsVectorLayer("data/derived/final-candidates.gpkg|layername=final-candidates", "Candidate Parcels", "ogr")
   p.addMapLayer(layer)
   p.write("project.qgz")
   ```

6. **Style Synchronization with Web View:**
   Replicate the web map's categorized symbols (`<renderer-v2 type="categorizedSymbol" attr="...">`), line widths, semi-transparent catchment buffers, and marker colors so the desktop view matches the web dashboard 1:1. Deliberate edits made in editable layers can be saved back to `data/overrides/` to update the pipeline.


## Troubleshooting common QGIS pain points

* **"GeoParquet shows up but won't load"** — your GDAL is old. QGIS 3.34+ with GDAL 3.8+ has stable GeoParquet support; older versions are flaky.
* **"CRS warning on every layer load"** — set the project CRS first, then load layers with matching CRS or with explicit reprojection.
* **"Processing algorithm not found"** — the relevant provider (GRASS / SAGA / WhiteboxTools / OTB) isn't enabled. `Settings → Options → Processing → Providers`.
* **"WhiteboxTools provider missing"** — install the WhiteboxTools binary separately, then point the plugin to it.
* **"Plugin doesn't show up after install"** — restart QGIS; check `Plugins → Manage and Install → Installed`; check the Python console for import errors.
