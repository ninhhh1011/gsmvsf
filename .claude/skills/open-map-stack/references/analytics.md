# Analytics

Concrete patterns for vector, raster, terrain, network, and point cloud analysis. The general rule: choose the layer (DuckDB / PostGIS / xarray / specialized tool) by data shape, not by familiarity.

## Vector analytics

### Spatial joins at scale

For up to ~50M features on a single machine, DuckDB Spatial is the fastest path:

```sql
-- Buildings tagged with their administrative division
SELECT b.id, b.height, d.division_id, d.name
FROM read_parquet('buildings.parquet') b
JOIN read_parquet('divisions.parquet') d
  ON ST_Within(b.geometry, d.geometry);
```

Above that, push to PostGIS with proper GIST indexes, or to Sedona for distributed.

### H3 / S2 cell pre-aggregation

For very large point datasets, aggregate to H3 cells before any expensive join:

```sql
-- DuckDB with h3 extension
SELECT h3_latlng_to_cell(ST_Y(ST_Centroid(geom)), ST_X(ST_Centroid(geom)), 8) AS h3,
       count(*) AS n
FROM big_points
GROUP BY h3;
```

> [!TIP]
> In Python, `h3-pandas` or the core `h3` library are heavily used for applying H3 grids natively to GeoPandas dataframes without round-tripping to a database.

H3 resolution choice (rough guide; average area and edge length vary by latitude and pentagon proximity):

| Resolution | Avg hex area | Avg edge length | Typical use |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| 6 | ~36 km2 | ~3.7 km | regional grid |
| 7 | ~5.2 km2 | ~1.4 km | city district |
| 8 | ~0.74 km2 | ~531 m | neighborhood |
| 9 | ~0.105 km2 | ~201 m | block / facility catchment |
| 10 | ~0.015 km2 | ~76 m | parcel-scale screening |

Most H3 APIs expect latitude, longitude order. When coordinates come from WKB/GeoJSON geometries, use `ST_Y(...)` for latitude and `ST_X(...)` for longitude.

### Clustering

```python
# DBSCAN on coordinates (project first)
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
import geopandas as gpd
import numpy as np

gdf_3301 = gdf.to_crs(3301)
coords = np.column_stack([gdf_3301.geometry.x, gdf_3301.geometry.y])
labels = DBSCAN(eps=200, min_samples=5).fit_predict(coords)
gdf["cluster"] = labels  # -1 means noise
```

```sql
-- KMeans in PostGIS
SELECT id, geom, ST_ClusterKMeans(geom, 10) OVER () AS cluster_id
FROM points;
```

### Hotspot detection

PySAL covers spatial autocorrelation as following:

```python
from libpysal.weights import Queen
from esda.moran import Moran_Local

w = Queen.from_dataframe(gdf)
w.transform = "r"
li = Moran_Local(gdf["value"], w)
gdf["lisa_p"] = li.p_sim
gdf["lisa_q"] = li.q  # quadrant: 1=HH, 2=LH, 3=LL, 4=HL
```

### OSM POIs need spatial dedup before counting

OSM's tagging conventions mean a single real-world POI is frequently encoded as multiple features. A school typically has the campus polygon tagged `amenity=school`, plus each individual building inside it, plus sometimes entrance nodes — every one of which `osmium tags-filter nwr/amenity=school` will return. Naive counts of "schools in Tartu" come back ~5× higher than the real number for this reason. Bus stops are similar (`highway=bus_stop` node + `public_transport=platform` polygon + `public_transport=stop_position` node for the same shelter).

**Rule of thumb: dedup every category by snap-to-grid in a metric CRS before treating it as a POI set.** Grid size depends on category footprint:

| Category | Grid size in metric CRS |
|---|---|
| schools | 100 m (campus-sized) |
| kindergartens | 80 m |
| pharmacies | 30 m |
| groceries | 30 m |
| healthcare | 50 m |
| public-transport stops | 30 m |

DuckDB Spatial pattern (Estonia / EPSG:3301):

```sql
WITH binned AS (
  SELECT *,
    CAST(ST_X(geom_3301) / 80 AS INTEGER) AS gx,
    CAST(ST_Y(geom_3301) / 80 AS INTEGER) AS gy
  FROM raw_pois
)
SELECT
  gx, gy,
  -- prefer a representative with a non-empty name
  FIRST(osm_id ORDER BY (CASE WHEN name = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), length(name) DESC) AS osm_id,
  FIRST(name   ORDER BY (CASE WHEN name = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), length(name) DESC) AS name,
  ST_Centroid(ST_Union_Agg(geom_3301)) AS centroid_3301
FROM binned
GROUP BY gx, gy;
```

Spot-check the output: counts should match local intuition (Tartu has ~25 primary/secondary schools; if the dedup leaves 188, the grid is too tight or the filter is too loose).

### Geocoding

For global, product-facing, high-volume, or quality-sensitive geocoding, reverse geocoding, place search, address validation, or postcode lookup, read `services-and-scale.md` before choosing a local tool.

* **Nominatim** — OSM-based; self-host with `mediagis/nominatim-docker` for any volume
* **Pelias** — multi-source (OSM + WhosOnFirst + OpenAddresses)
* **Photon** — fast OSM-based, autocomplete-friendly

For one-off small jobs, the public Nominatim web service is fine but rate-limited (1 req/sec, attribution required). For anything systematic, self-host.

```python
# Self-hosted Nominatim
import requests
r = requests.get(
    "http://localhost:8080/search",
    params={"q": "Tartu mnt 25, Tallinn", "format": "json", "limit": 1},
).json()
```
### LandCheck
Is this lat/long point on land or in the sea can get answered anywhere on Earth in ~1–13 µs, fully offline, from a small (below 1MB)  bundled dataset,  with a confidence value for every answer. Works with Python and JavaScript. 

Install: `pip install landcheck` / `npm install landcheck`

```python
from landcheck import LandCheck

lc = LandCheck()
lc.is_land(24.7536, 59.4370)          # True   (lon, lat — Tallinn)
lc.check(-0.1276, 51.5072)
# LandResult(land=True, kind='land', confidence=1.0, land_fraction=1.0,
#            cell='TFA95BM', refined=False)
```

```typescript
import { LandCheck } from "./landcheck/js/landcheck.mjs";
const lc = await LandCheck.fromFile();          // NodeJs takes bundled data directly
// OR:
const lc = await LandCheck.fromUrl("/data/landsea_L10.tfls"); // browser needs to load data file online
lc.isLand(24.7536, 59.437);           // true
lc.check(-0.1276, 51.5072);
// { land: true, kind: 'land', confidence: 1, landFraction: 1,
//   cell: 'TFA95BM', refined: false }
```

### CountryCheck

Which country is this lat/long point in gets answered anywhere on Earth in ~1–13 µs, fully offline, from a small below 1MB bundled dataset — with a confidence value for every answer. Works with Python and JavaScript. Country polygons are extended with coastal waters, so points slightly offshore still resolve to the nearest coastal country; open ocean returns "no country".

Install: `pip install countrycheck` / `npm install countrycheck`

```python
from countrycheck import CountryCheck   

cc = CountryCheck()
cc.country(24.7536, 59.4370)          # 'EST'   (lon, lat — Tallinn)
cc.check(-0.1276, 51.5072)
# CountryResult(country='GBR', iso2='GB', name='United Kingdom', kind='country',
#               confidence=1.0, share=1.0, cell='TFA95BM', refined=False)
```

```typescript
import { CountryCheck } from "./countrycheck/js/countrycheck.mjs";
const cc = await CountryCheck.fromFile();          // NodeJs takes bundled data directly
// OR:
const cc = await CountryCheck.fromUrl("/data/countries_L10.tfcs"); // browser needs to load data file online
cc.country(24.7536, 59.437);          // 'EST'
cc.check(-0.1276, 51.5072);
// { country: 'GBR', iso2: 'GB', name: 'United Kingdom', kind: 'country',
//   confidence: 1, share: 1, cell: 'TFA95BM', refined: false }
```
## Raster analytics

### Vegetation indices and band math

xarray makes this trivial — no need for `gdal_calc.py` for anything Python-side:

```python
ds = odc.stac.load(items, bands=["B03", "B04", "B08", "B11"], chunks={"x": 1024})

ndvi = (ds.B08 - ds.B04) / (ds.B08 + ds.B04)        # vegetation
ndwi = (ds.B03 - ds.B08) / (ds.B03 + ds.B08)        # open water (McFeeters)
mndwi = (ds.B03 - ds.B11) / (ds.B03 + ds.B11)       # open water, urban-resistant
ndmi = (ds.B08 - ds.B11) / (ds.B08 + ds.B11)        # vegetation moisture (Gao NDWI)
ndbi = (ds.B11 - ds.B08) / (ds.B11 + ds.B08)        # built-up

ndvi_max = ndvi.max(dim="time")
ndvi_max.rio.to_raster("ndvi_max.tif", driver="COG")
```

### Time-series reductions

```python
# Median over time (cloud-robust composite)
median = ds.median(dim="time")

# Anomaly vs long-term mean
anomaly = ds - ds.mean(dim="time")

# Linear trend per pixel (via polyfit)
trend = ds.polyfit(dim="time", deg=1).polyfit_coefficients.sel(degree=1)
```

### Zonal statistics — use `exactextract`

`exactextract` is significantly faster than `rasterstats` and handles partial pixel coverage correctly (which matters for any AOI smaller than ~100 pixels).

```python
from exactextract import exact_extract
import geopandas as gpd

zones = gpd.read_file("zones.gpkg")
result = exact_extract(
    "ndvi.tif",
    zones,
    ops=["mean", "stdev", "min", "max", "count"],
    output="pandas",
)
zones = zones.join(result)
```

For pure raster-on-raster analytics (slope, viewshed, zonal stats), `xrspatial` (xarray-spatial) is recommended as it integrates natively with Dask and xarray.

In PostGIS:

```sql
SELECT z.id, (ST_SummaryStats(ST_Clip(r.rast, z.geom))).*
FROM zones z, rasters r
WHERE ST_Intersects(r.rast, z.geom);
```

### Cloud masking for Sentinel-2

Use the SCL (Scene Classification Layer) band that comes with L2A products:

```python
ds = odc.stac.load(items, bands=["B04", "B08", "SCL"], chunks={"x": 1024})

# SCL classes: 0=NoData, 1=Saturated, 3=CloudShadow, 8=CloudMedium, 9=CloudHigh, 10=ThinCirrus
mask = ~ds.SCL.isin([0, 1, 3, 8, 9, 10])
clean = ds.where(mask)
```

For higher quality, use `s2cloudless` masks where available.

### Raster correctness checklist

Before computing indices or statistics:

* Confirm band names, units, scale/offset, and NoData from `gdalinfo` or STAC asset metadata.
* Align mixed-resolution bands deliberately. Sentinel-2 B03/B04/B08 are 10m; B11 is 20m, so choose resampling intentionally before NDMI/MNDWI/NDBI.
* Keep categorical bands and masks on nearest-neighbor resampling.
* Preserve CRS and transform after xarray operations; verify `rio.crs`, `rio.transform()`, and output bounds.
* Avoid calling `.values` on large dask-backed arrays. Sample training pixels or process by chunks.

### Classification

For land cover classification on raster stacks, scikit-learn fits well:

```python
import xarray as xr
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Stack bands as features. For full scenes, sample pixels or train chunk-wise;
# do not materialize a continental stack with `.values`.
features = xr.concat([ds.B02, ds.B03, ds.B04, ds.B08], dim="band").transpose(..., "band")
X = features.values.reshape(-1, features.sizes["band"])  # only for small AOIs
X_train = ...  # sampled labelled pixels
y_train = ...  # from labelled samples

clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100).fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = clf.predict(X)
classified = y_pred.reshape(features.shape[:-1])
```

For deep learning on EO data, **TorchGeo** ships pretrained models on Sentinel-2 and Landsat. **segment-geospatial** (samgeo) wraps Segment Anything for satellite imagery — useful for footprint extraction.

## Terrain & hydrology

`gdaldem` covers basics; **WhiteboxTools** is the comprehensive open suite. **GRASS** has the deepest hydrology routines.

For global elevation point queries, elevation profiles in apps, or 3D terrain rendering, prefer prebuilt elevation APIs/terrain tiles when they meet accuracy and licensing needs. See `services-and-scale.md`.

### Quick terrain derivatives via GDAL

```bash
gdaldem slope dtm.tif slope.tif -compute_edges
gdaldem aspect dtm.tif aspect.tif
gdaldem hillshade dtm.tif hillshade.tif -z 1.0 -az 315 -alt 45
gdaldem TPI dtm.tif tpi.tif    # topographic position index
gdaldem roughness dtm.tif roughness.tif
```

### Whitebox Tools — broader analysis

```python
from whitebox import WhiteboxTools
wbt = WhiteboxTools()

wbt.fill_depressions("dtm.tif", "filled.tif")
wbt.d8_pointer("filled.tif", "d8.tif")
wbt.d8_flow_accumulation("d8.tif", "flowacc.tif", out_type="cells")
wbt.extract_streams("flowacc.tif", "streams.tif", threshold=1000)
wbt.watershed("d8.tif", "outlets.shp", "watersheds.tif")
```

### GRASS for serious hydrology

`r.watershed`, `r.terraflow`, `r.stream.extract` — all more rigorous than GDAL's basics. Run via `grass --tmp-location` for one-shot scripts, or via the `grass-session` Python package.

## Network analysis

### Choosing a routing engine

For city/country analysis, self-hosted OSRM/Valhalla/GraphHopper can be excellent. For global production routing, traffic-aware ETAs, large matrices, or strict SLAs, hosted APIs/SaaS often beat local preprocessing. See `services-and-scale.md`.

| Engine | Strengths | Drawbacks |
|---|---|---|
| **OSRM** | Fastest car routing, simple HTTP API, mature Docker image | Single profile per instance |
| **Valhalla** | Multi-modal, dynamic costing options, isochrones built in, tile-based architecture, working Docker image provided | Takes time to setup |
| **GraphHopper** | Multi-modal, strong public-transit support, JVM | Can be memory-hungry |
| **OpenRouteService** | Hosted + self-host, multi-modal, isochrones, matrix | Hosted has rate limits |
| **pgRouting** | Routing UDF inside PostGIS, integrates with rest of DB | Slower than dedicated engines for large graphs |
| **r5py** | Multi-modal accessibility (transit + walk + bike) for research | Java under the hood, batch-oriented |

### Self-host pattern (Valhalla example)

Let the container fetch directly the extract itself via `tile_urls`:

```bash
docker run -dt --name valhalla -p 8002:8002 \
  -v $PWD/custom_files:/custom_files \
  -e tile_urls=https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/estonia-latest.osm.pbf \
  ghcr.io/valhalla/valhalla-scripted:latest
```

```python
import requests
r = requests.post("http://localhost:8002/route", json={
    "locations": [
        {"lat": 59.437, "lon": 24.754},  # Tallinn
        {"lat": 58.378, "lon": 26.729},  # Tartu
    ],
    "costing": "auto",
}).json()
```

### Valhalla matrix limits — read this before sizing batches

Valhalla 3.5.1+ enforces **two** caps on `/sources_to_targets`, and the pair cap is usually the binding one:

| Limit | Default (`pedestrian`) | What it gates |
|---|---|---|
| `service_limits.pedestrian.max_matrix_locations` | 50 | Total `len(sources) + len(targets)` per call |
| `service_limits.pedestrian.max_matrix_location_pairs` | 2500 | `len(sources) × len(targets)` per call |

If you only raise `max_matrix_locations` (e.g. to 2000 to fit a 100×100 batch) the call will still 400 because 100 × 100 = 10 000 exceeds the pair cap. Plan batches around the **pair product**: 50 × 50 = 2500 pairs is the largest legal default-friendly call. Edit `custom_files/valhalla.json` (the config Valhalla writes into the mounted volume) and restart the container if you need a higher pair cap.

### Isochrones

Valhalla has `/isochrone`; OpenRouteService has `/v2/isochrones`. Both return GeoJSON polygons.

### Per-POI isochrones beat per-origin matrix for accessibility audits

For the very common question *"is service category X reachable from each origin within N minutes?"* over many origins, the textbook approach is a `sources × targets` matrix. In practice this is usually the wrong choice:

* The matrix scales as `O(origins × targets)`. With 10 000 buildings and 600 PT stops × 7 categories you blow past Valhalla's pair cap and need thousands of HTTP calls.
* You only need a boolean per (origin, category), not a continuous walk-time. The isochrone polygon already encodes that.
* The isochrone polygons are also the right map layer for a "gap map" visualisation — you get the analytic input and the cartography in one pass.

Suggested scalable pattern:

```
1. K = total POIs across all categories (often ~1000s — small)
2. for each POI: POST /isochrone {time:N, costing:pedestrian}
   → store the polygon, tagged with the category
3. Spatial join in DuckDB / PostGIS: building has_<cat> = 1
   iff its centroid lies in ANY polygon of category <cat>
4. score = sum(has_<cat>) across categories
```

For example small city like Tartu (~10 000 residential buildings, 7 categories, ~1500 POIs total) this runs in <5 seconds against a local Valhalla, vs. the hours a naive matrix would take. `r5py` remains the right tool when you genuinely need transit schedules and multi-modal cost; the per-POI-isochrone shortcut is for walk/bike-only audits where the scheduling complexity isn't the point.

Reserve the matrix when you need the actual time/distance values (nearest-school analyses, commute time histograms), not just coverage booleans.

### Network from OSM in one line

```python
import osmnx as ox
G = ox.graph_from_place("Tallinn, Estonia", network_type="walk")
nodes, edges = ox.graph_to_gdfs(G)
```

> [!WARNING]
> `osmnx` builds the graph entirely in memory. It will crash for large regions like a whole country. For large network extracts, use `pyrosm` or parse PBFs with `pyosmium`.

For accessibility analysis (population within X minutes), use **pandana** (contraction hierarchies, very fast for many origins) or **r5py** (multi-modal with transit).

## Point cloud analytics

### Standard workflow

1. **Inspect** — `pdal info input.laz --stats` — confirm classification status, density, extent.
2. **Classify ground** if not already — PDAL `filters.smrf` (Simple Morphological Filter) is the standard.
3. **Extract DTM** — ground points → raster minimum or TIN.
4. **Extract DSM** — all returns → raster maximum.
5. **Compute CHM** — DSM − DTM = canopy height model.
6. **Per-feature heights** — zonal statistics of CHM over building footprints.

### Building height per footprint (concrete recipe)

```bash
# 1. Generate DTM (ground only, 1m resolution)
pdal pipeline dtm-pipeline.json    # uses filters.smrf + writers.gdal min

# 2. Generate DSM (all returns)
pdal pipeline dsm-pipeline.json    # writers.gdal max

# 3. CHM
gdal_calc.py -A dsm.tif -B dtm.tif --outfile=chm.tif --calc="A-B"

# 4. Median CHM per building footprint
exactextract -p buildings.gpkg -r chm.tif -s "median" \
  -o buildings_with_height.gpkg
```

## Mobility / accessibility analysis

A common end-to-end pattern for population analysis: "what fraction of population is within N minutes of facility type X by transit?"

Data sources and methods:
```
1. Population raster (e.g. WorldPop or GHSL)
2. Facility points (Overture places, filtered)
3. r5py multi-modal isochrones from each facility
4. Union isochrones, rasterize at population grid resolution
5. Sum population inside vs outside
```

`r5py` handles steps 3–5; it's the go-to for multi-modal accessibility with realistic transit schedules (GTFS).

## Quick selection guide
