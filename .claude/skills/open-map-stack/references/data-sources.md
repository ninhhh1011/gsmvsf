# Data Sources

Strategies and concrete commands for discovering and acquiring open geospatial data. Discovery comes before download; STAC is the modern catalog protocol for raster, and Overture's STAC + GeoParquet pattern increasingly applies to vector basemaps too.

## Discovery hierarchy — try in this order

1. **Existing STAC catalogs** — for any raster, satellite, or EO data
2. **A Portolan catalog**, when the user names one or points at a catalog root — a static STAC catalog whose datasets are already cloud-native and self-documenting
3. **Overture Maps** — for global building, place, transportation, address basemap
4. **OpenStreetMap (via Overpass or extracts)** — for detailed local features Overture doesn't cover
5. **National / regional portals** — for authoritative or jurisdiction-specific data
6. **Specialist datasets** — building footprints (Microsoft, Google), elevation (Copernicus DEM), point clouds (OpenTopography), weather/climate (ECMWF, NOAA)

Only fall back to ad-hoc downloads when the above don't cover the need.

## STAC — SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog

The default protocol for raster discovery. Every major satellite imagery provider now exposes a STAC API.

### Primary STAC endpoints

| Catalog | URL | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| Microsoft Planetary Computer | `https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1` | Sentinel, Landsat, MODIS, NAIP, climate, DEMs — broadest |
| Element 84 Earth Search | `https://earth-search.aws.element84.com/v1` | Sentinel-2 L2A on AWS COG |
| Copernicus Data Space | `https://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/stac` | Official Sentinel access |
| USGS LandsatLook | `https://landsatlook.usgs.gov/stac-server` | Landsat archive |
| Overture Maps | `https://labs.overturemaps.org/stac/catalog.json` | Vector basemap themes (addresses, buildings, places, transportation, divisions) |

### Search pattern (Python)

```python
from pystac_client import Client
import planetary_computer  # for MS PC, signs asset URLs

client = Client.open(
    "https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1",
    modifier=planetary_computer.sign_inplace,
)
items = client.search(
    collections=["sentinel-2-l2a"],
    bbox=[24.5, 59.3, 25.0, 59.5],   # Tallinn area
    datetime="2025-06-01/2025-08-31",
    query={"eo:cloud_cover": {"lt": 20}},
).item_collection()
```

### Lazy load to xarray (preferred over manual download)

```python
import odc.stac
ds = odc.stac.load(
    items,
    bands=["red", "green", "blue", "nir"],
    chunks={"x": 1024, "y": 1024},  # dask-backed
    resolution=10,
    crs="EPSG:3301",  # reproject during load
)
# Now ds is lazy — only computes when .compute() or .to_zarr() is called
```

`stackstac` is an alternative; `odc-stac` is generally more featureful.

### Cost-aware planning

Use `estimate_data_size` (available via STAC MCP) or compute the bbox-clipped pixel count yourself before pulling. Sentinel-2 L2A at 10m resolution over a 1° bbox is roughly 10GB per scene — plan accordingly.

## Portolan catalogs

[Portolan](https://portolan-sdi.org/) publishes geospatial data as a **static STAC catalog on object storage** instead of a WMS/WFS/Feature server: vector as GeoParquet paired with PMTiles, raster as COG, tabular as plain Parquet with no geometry column. There is no API to call. You read the JSON, then query the files in place over HTTP range requests — the access pattern this toolkit already defaults to.

**Recognize one by:** a `catalog.json` root served from a bucket, an `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` beside every catalog and collection, and `stac_extensions` carrying a `https://schemas.portolan-sdi.org/portolan/<version>/schema.json` URI. That URI is the only signal of the spec version.

```
catalog-root/
├── catalog.json                 # root STAC Catalog; children via rel: child
├── AGENTS.md                    # linked rel: agents
├── README.md                    # linked rel: describedby
└── {collection_id}/
    ├── collection.json          # extent, providers, license, assets, links
    ├── AGENTS.md, README.md
    ├── {data}.parquet           # asset with role: data
    ├── {data}.pmtiles           # rel: pmtiles link / role: visual
    └── styles/default.json      # asset with role: style + default
```

### Working rules

* **Read the collection's `AGENTS.md` before writing a query.** This is the point of the format: it names the join keys, the CRS, the useful aggregations, and the data-quality traps. Skipping it and inferring the schema from `DESCRIBE` is how you get a plausible wrong answer.
* **Select assets by `roles`, never by asset key.** `data` is the primary Parquet/COG, `visual` the PMTiles, `style` a MapLibre style, `collection-mirror` an `items.parquet` you should query instead of fetching every item JSON.
* **A collection with no `data` asset is not empty — it is partitioned.** Large collections put the files behind a `partition:glob` and/or one item per partition, and the `data` role then sits on the *item*, not the collection. Read the glob or the items; do not conclude the collection has nothing to query. Where the collection publishes an `items.parquet` (`collection-mirror`), query that to find partitions instead of fetching hundreds of item JSONs.
* **Use the `https` href.** An `s3://`/`gs://` URL may appear under `alternate`; do not hand-rewrite one form into the other.
* Query it with the standard DuckDB pattern (`INSTALL spatial; INSTALL httpfs;`) from `spatial-sql.md` — nothing Portolan-specific is required.

### Dedicated skills

`portolan-sdi/portolan-skills` publishes [Agent Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/agent-skills) for this, and they are more detailed than this section: **`reading-portolan`** for consuming a catalog (metadata, assets by role, DuckDB queries, cross-dataset joins, partitioned collections, PMTiles maps), plus publisher-side skills (`portolan-bootstrap`, `portolan-cli`, `portolan-migrate`, `git-backed-catalog`). Prefer them when they are installed; how to install them is agent-specific. `portolan-sdi/portolan-spec` is ground truth when a catalog and any skill disagree, and rule ids such as `PORTO-CORE-027` point into its `requirements.yaml`.

### Pinning a Portolan source

A Portolan collection carries most of what `project-spec.md` requires, so map it across rather than inventing provenance:

| Manifest field | Take from |
|---|---|
| `version.identifier` / `published_at` | collection `updated`, plus the `schemas.portolan-sdi.org` version URI |
| `license` | the SPDX `license` field, or the `rel: license` link when it is `other` |
| provider / authority | `providers` — at least one `producer` and exactly one `host`, host last |
| upstream original | `rel: via` (and `rel: canonical`) on a mirror |

Two traps specific to this mapping:

* **A catalog whose `producer` and `host` differ is a mirror, not the authority.** Its top-level `updated` is the last *sync* time, not the source's publication date. Pin and attribute the original through the `via` link; a mirror can silently lag.
* **`file:checksum` is multihash-encoded, not a raw sha256 string.** Copying it straight into a `sha256:` pin field records a value that will never match the bytes. Decode it, or hash the retrieved file yourself — `local_snapshot` pins are verified against real content.

## Overture Maps — modern open vector basemap

Conflated open data (OSM + Meta + Esri + Microsoft + Google) under permissive licensing. Released monthly. Distributed as GeoParquet + PMTiles via STAC catalog.

Before writing a direct S3/Azure path, check the release calendar and use a release still present in the public buckets. Overture keeps only recent public releases for GDPR/right-to-be-forgotten reasons. For long-lived pipelines, pin the release and mirror the raw inputs or build an internal archive.

Themes:

* **addresses** — global address points
* **base** — water, land cover, infrastructure
* **buildings** — global building footprints with heights. Note that `theme=buildings` contains both `type=building` and `type=building_part` (useful for 3D mapping).
* **divisions** — administrative boundaries
* **places** — POIs (categories in transition; use `basic_category` going forward)
* **transportation** — roads, segments, connectors

### Download (CLI)

```bash
# Install once
pip install overturemaps

# Bbox download for one theme
overturemaps download \
  --bbox=24.5,59.3,25.0,59.5 \
  --type=building \
  -f geoparquet \
  -o tallinn_buildings.parquet
```

### Query directly on S3 (preferred for ad-hoc analysis)

DuckDB reads Overture's GeoParquet over HTTP without downloading:

```sql
INSTALL httpfs; LOAD httpfs;
INSTALL spatial; LOAD spatial;

-- Replace OVERTURE_RELEASE with a currently retained release from:
-- https://docs.overturemaps.org/release-calendar/
-- Pin the chosen release in your manifest; do not commit "latest".
SELECT id, names.primary AS name, height, geometry
FROM read_parquet(
  's3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/OVERTURE_RELEASE/theme=buildings/type=building/*.parquet',
  filename = true, hive_partitioning = 1
)
WHERE bbox.xmax >= 24.5 AND bbox.xmin <= 25.0
  AND bbox.ymax >= 59.3 AND bbox.ymin <= 59.5;
```

The `bbox` column is a struct (`xmin`, `ymin`, `xmax`, `ymax`) that Overture emits specifically to enable predicate pushdown. Use bbox **overlap** as the scan gate so features crossing the area edge are included. For named-area queries, resolve the real boundary first and add an exact spatial predicate such as `ST_Intersects`; bbox alone is rectangular and will overshoot.

### License note

Overture data is mostly CDLA-Permissive 2.0, but Foursquare-sourced places are Apache 2.0, and OSM-derived data inherits ODbL obligations (share-alike + attribution). The `sources` array on each feature records provenance — preserve it.

## OpenStreetMap

Use when Overture doesn't have the feature class needed (footpaths, fine-grained POI tags, niche infrastructure), for very recent edits, or for tag-level richness Overture filters out.

### Choosing the access method

| Need | Tool |
|---|---|
| Small bbox, ad-hoc query, < 25k features | Overpass API |
| Country / region extract | Geofabrik, BBBike, NextGIS |
| Whole planet | planet.osm.pbf (~80GB compressed) |
| Iterative refinement, custom filters | `osmium` on a local extract |
| Routable graph for one shot | `osmnx` |

### Overpass via Python

```python
import overpy
api = overpy.Overpass()
result = api.query("""
[out:json][timeout:60];
area["ISO3166-1"="EE"]->.searchArea;
node(area.searchArea)["amenity"="cafe"];
out body;
""")
```

> [!WARNING]
> Public Overpass API instances (`overpass-api.de`, etc.) are heavily rate-limited. For large areas (e.g., country-wide), always download a Geofabrik extract instead of slamming the public API.

### Local extract + osmium (for anything serious)

```bash
# Pull Estonia from Geofabrik, all other countries are available in same way
wget https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/estonia-latest.osm.pbf

# Filter to POIs
osmium tags-filter estonia-latest.osm.pbf \
  n/amenity=cafe,restaurant,bar \
  -o estonia-food.osm.pbf

# Convert to GeoParquet via ogr2ogr
ogr2ogr -f Parquet estonia-food.parquet estonia-food.osm.pbf points
```

### Load OSM directly to PostGIS

```bash
osm2pgsql -d gisdb --slim -G --hstore -C 4000 \
  -S /usr/share/osm2pgsql/default.style \
  estonia-latest.osm.pbf
```

`--slim` keeps update-able tables; `-G` produces multipolygons; `-C 4000` is RAM cache in MB.

## Specialist data sources

### Building footprints

* **Microsoft Global Building Footprints** — global, public domain (ODbL where derived from OSM). Released as country-wise GeoJSON or GeoPackage on GitHub.
* **Google Open Buildings** — Africa, South Asia, SE Asia, LATAM. CSV + Parquet.
* **Overture Buildings** — conflates the above with OSM and is usually the simplest entry point now.

### Elevation

* **Copernicus DEM (GLO-30)** — 30m global, the modern default. Available via STAC on Microsoft Planetary Computer.
* **SRTM** — older but proven, 30m or 90m resolution grids in global level
* **National LiDAR-derived DTMs** — for any country with open LiDAR (Estonia: Maa- ja Ruumiamet ~1m DTM under CC-BY)

### Point clouds

* **USGS 3DEP** — US LiDAR
* **OpenTopography** — research repository, global
* **National open LiDAR** — many EU countries, including Estonia (Maa- ja Ruumiamet)
* Distributed as LAZ format; cloud-native form is COPC

### Weather and Climate

* **Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS)** — ERA5 reanalysis, seasonal forecasts. Usually distributed as NetCDF/GRIB.
* **ECMWF Open Data** — forecast models, real-time data.
* **NOAA AWS Registry** — GFS, HRRR, NEXRAD radar (often available as Zarr or NetCDF).

### Administrative, population, land cover, and mobility

* **Natural Earth** — small-scale countries, admin boundaries, populated places; public domain and useful for global overview maps.
* **geoBoundaries** — research-grade administrative boundaries with explicit licensing; useful when national portals are inconsistent.
* **Overture divisions / OSM boundaries** — practical defaults for admin joins when official boundaries are not required.
* **GHSL / WorldPop** — population grids for exposure and accessibility analysis; record vintage, resolution, and license.
* **ESA WorldCover / Copernicus Land Monitoring** — open land-cover layers; note class schema and year.
* **GTFS feeds** — transit (bus, train etc) schedules for accessibility and routing; license varies by operator, so record feed URL, download date, and terms.

### Place identifiers and global addressing

Prefer stable identifiers over name-only joins. Store the namespace with the ID (`unlocode`, `geonames`, `wikidata`, `osm`, `wof`, provider-specific place ID) so IDs from different systems cannot be confused.

* **UN/LOCODE** — United Nations code for trade and transport locations; use for ports, airports, terminals, logistics hubs, and shipping/trade analytics.
* **GeoNames ID** — broad global gazetteer identifier for populated places and physical features; useful for coarse global joins and fallback search.
* **Wikidata QID** — cross-domain entity identifier; useful for linking places to external facts, but geometry and admin hierarchy quality varies.
* **OpenStreetMap IDs** — useful for OSM-derived workflows; store element type (`node`, `way`, `relation`) because numeric IDs are not globally unique across types.
* **Who's On First IDs** — useful for place hierarchies and historical/admin boundary context.
* **Provider place IDs** — Google Place IDs, HERE IDs, Mapbox IDs, etc. are service-specific; check storage and reuse terms before persisting them.
* **Open Location Code / Plus Codes** — open, offline-computable global addressing code for places without reliable street addresses. A full code identifies an area, not a parcel or legal address; short codes need a reference locality.
* **Postcodes / ZIP codes** — postal geography is operational, not always polygonal or stable. Use national authoritative datasets where possible; for global coverage consider GeoNames postal codes, OpenAddresses, provider APIs, or paid postal-code datasets.

### OGC services and portals

For WMS/WFS/WMTS/OGC API endpoints, start with `GetCapabilities` or the landing page before guessing layer names. Record service URL, layer ID, CRS, time dimension, paging limit, and terms of use in the manifest.

Use CLI tools like GDAL to process and convert data to geoparquet (or other suitable file format), instead of expensive direct usage of WMS/WFS/WMTS/OGC API http endpoints.

Common traps:

* WMS 1.3.0 with `EPSG:4326` may use latitude/longitude bbox order; `CRS:84` uses longitude/latitude.
* WFS often needs `count`/`startIndex` paging and an explicit `outputFormat` such as GeoJSON or GML.
* WMTS tile matrix sets may not be Web Mercator; read the matrix set before constructing tile URLs.

## Estonia-specific sources (regional context)

* **Ruumiandmete kataloog (Estonian spatial data catalog / INSPIRE metadata)** — the authoritative discovery point for Estonian geodata metadata, with a search UI and an API for machine retrieval:
  * Catalog: https://metadata.geoportaal.ee/geonetwork/srv/est/catalog.search#/home
  * API reference: https://metadata.geoportaal.ee/geonetwork/doc/api/index.html
  Use it to find the current, official records and OGC endpoints for any Estonian dataset (cadastre, roads, buildings, elevations) instead of guessing brochure URLs.
* **Maa- ja Ruumiamet spatial data downloads (general)** — the Geoportal "Spatial Data" section lists ready-to-download national datasets (topographic, cadastral, addresses, orthophotos, elevations) with links to per-dataset pages:
  * Index: https://geoportaal.maaruum.ee/eng/spatial-data-p58.html
  * Many datasets offer **bulk downloads by county (maakond) and municipality** in GPKG / SHP / GeoJSON / DXF — a preferred path over WFS paging for whole-region pulls (no server-side paging, deterministic files, well-suited to reproducing a project).
* **Maa- ja Ruumiamet (Estonian Land and Spatial Development Board, formerly Maa-amet)** — geoportaal.maaruum.ee. WMS / WFS / WMTS endpoints for base and thematic maps. Topographic data, orthophotos, LiDAR DTMs, cadastre. Most data is open under CC-BY 4.0 with attribution to Maa- ja Ruumiamet.
* **Maa- ja Ruumiamet cadastral data** — the Geoportal's Cadastral Data page provides the authoritative cadastral unit (maaüksus) geometry/attributes as **bulk downloads by county and municipality** in GPKG / SHP / GeoJSON / DGN / DXF / TAB:
  * Catalog page: https://geoportaal.maaruum.ee/eng/spatial-data/cadastral-data-p310.html
  * Direct S3 download pattern: `https://s3.pilw.io/rp-kemit-kataster/ANDMED/{County}_maakond_KATASTER_{FORMAT}.zip` (e.g. `Tartu_maakond_KATASTER_GPKG.zip`) and `{Municipality}_KATASTER_{FORMAT}.zip` (e.g. `Tartu_linn_KATASTER_GPKG.zip`, `Tallinn_KATASTER_GPKG.zip`).
  * Direct file inside archive: `{County}_maakond_KATASTER_{FORMAT}.gpkg` (contains table/layer `"{County} maakond"` with 79,000+ parcels in EPSG:3301, attributes: `tunnus` (cadastral id), `l_aadress` (address), `ov_nimi` (municipality), `siht1` (land use: `MAATULUNDUSMAA`, `ELAMUMAA`, `TOOTMISMAA`, `ARIMAA`), `pindala` (area in m²)).
  * For a bounded, reproducible pull (e.g. `Tartu_maakond_KATASTER_GPKG.zip`), prefer the direct county GPKG download over WFS paging.
* **ETAK (Estonian Topographic Database)** — vector base data, downloadable as Shapefile / GPKG and also served via WFS. Layers cover 39 themes (kõlvikud / teed / veekogud / ehitised / pinnavormid). Ready to use files in different vector formats: https://geoportaal.maaruum.ee/est/ruumiandmed/eesti-topograafia-andmekogu/laadi-etak-andmed-alla-p609.html (or more current address)
* Some **municipalities** have own open data portals sharing also useful data GIS data and these are worth to be checked out. For example **Tartu** has https://geohub.tartulv.ee/, **Tallinn** has https://www.tallinn.ee/et/geoportaal/ruumiandmed and there can be others. These may give more up-to-date and richer datasets than global OpenStreetMap and Overture for similar themes.
* **Default CRS for Estonia: EPSG:3301 (L-EST97 / Estonian Coordinate System of 1997)**. Convert from WGS84 with `pyproj` or `gdalwarp -t_srs EPSG:3301`.

### ETAK WFS — programmatic access

The legacy `https://teenus.maaamet.ee/ows/wfs_etak` endpoint that older docs reference is dead. The live WFS lives on the Environment Agency's GeoServer at:

```
https://gsavalik.envir.ee/geoserver/etak/wfs
```

Layer naming is `etak:e_<code>_<name>_<geom>`, where `<geom>` is `j` (joon / line), `p` (punkt / point), `a` (ala / area / polygon), or `ka` (kinnine ala / closed-polygon area). The most useful layers:

| Layer | Theme |
|---|---|
| `etak:e_401_hoone_ka` | Buildings (hoone) — polygons |
| `etak:e_404_maaalune_hoone_ka` | Underground buildings |
| `etak:e_402_korgrajatis_p` | Tall structures (towers, masts) |
| `etak:e_501_tee_j` / `_a` | Roads — line / area |
| `etak:e_502_roobastee_j` | Railway lines |
| `etak:e_201_meri_a` / `e_202_seisuveekogu_a` / `e_203_vooluveekogu_a` | Sea / lakes / rivers |
| `etak:e_303_haritav_maa_a` / `e_305_puittaimestik_a` | Cropland / forest |

**Building filter (residential):** the `e_401_hoone_ka` schema carries `tyyp` (Estonian use-type code). Filter `tyyp = 10` (Elu- või ühiskondlik hoone — residential or public) and require `ehr_gid IS NOT NULL` to drop foundation-only outlines (`tyyp = 30`). Use `ads_lahiaadress` for the postal address. Curl-ready example for a Tartu bbox in EPSG:3301:

```bash
curl "https://gsavalik.envir.ee/geoserver/etak/wfs?service=WFS&version=2.0.0&request=GetFeature\
&typeNames=etak:e_401_hoone_ka\
&srsName=EPSG:4326\
&outputFormat=application/json\
&bbox=657000,6471000,670000,6480000,EPSG:3301\
&count=5000"
```

GeoServer pages 5000 features at a time by default; loop with `startIndex` until a page returns fewer than the page size.

### Estonian OSM admin levels

Estonia uses different `admin_level` values from the OSM defaults most generic docs assume. If you copy a query that says `admin_level=8` for a city, you'll get nothing for any Estonian municipality.

| `admin_level` | Estonia meaning |
|---|---|
| 4 | Country (Eesti) |
| 6 | Maakond (county) |
| 7 | Linn / vald (municipality) — the right level for "city of Tartu", "city of Tallinn" |
| 8 | Asustusüksus (settlement unit, optional) |
| 9 | Sub-area, neighbourhood (rare) |

Concrete relation IDs: Tartu linn = `351439` (al=7), Tartu maakond = `351246` (al=6), Tallinn = `2618383` (al=7). Stable OSM relation IDs are far easier to query than name + `admin_level` filters. Overpass example:

```
[out:json][timeout:60];
relation(351439);                 -- Tartu linn (admin_level=7)
out geom;
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Post-2017 administrative reform:** the 2017 reform consolidated 213 municipalities to 79; many city polygons absorbed surrounding rural land. Modern *Tartu linn* as official municipality is ~154 km², not the historic ~38 km² urban core. Always check the polygon area before assuming "the city" matches the historic centre — building counts and POI density estimates that assume the small polygon will be wildly off.

* **Maa- ja Ruumiamet WMS example:**

  ```
  https://kaart.maaamet.ee/wms/alus?
    SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.3.0&REQUEST=GetCapabilities
  ```
Note that kaart.maaamet.ee/wms/alus only supports EPSG:3301 (Estonian national grid) and EPSG:4326 (WGS84). Leaflet's standard slippy map requests WMS tiles in EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator), which the server rejects with HTTP 500.

Fix is to use Maa-amet's WMTS REST tile service at tiles.maaamet.ee, which serves a @GMC (Google Mercator = EPSG:3857) tileset. The {-y} template variable handles TMS-to-XYZ Y-axis inversion automatically in Leaflet.

## MCP servers for catalog-driven discovery

For LLM-orchestrated workflows, these MCP servers replace manual catalog browsing:

| Server | Repo | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **STAC MCP** | `BnJam/stac-mcp` | Search any STAC catalog (Microsoft PC by default), with `estimate_data_size` for lazy planning. Federated multi-catalog search. |
| **OSM MCP (Python)** | `jagan-shanmugam/open-streetmap-mcp` | Geocoding, POI search, routing primitives. Broad tool surface. |
| **OSM MCP (Go)** | `NERVsystems/osmmcp` | Performance-focused, OSRM + Nominatim under the hood. |
| **gis-mcp** | `mahdin75/gis-mcp` | Geometry ops + STAC-backed Sentinel/Landsat band downloads + map generation. |

A useful baseline configuration: STAC MCP + one OSM MCP + gis-mcp, plus a custom Overture or PostGIS MCP for organization-specific data.

### When discovery via MCP beats discovery via CLI

* Iterative refinement — "narrow this further", "what about this time window instead"
* Cross-catalog comparison
* Cost / size estimation before commit
* Mixing vector and raster discovery in one conversation

When the bbox and time window are already known and the task is purely batch ingestion, plain `pystac-client` is leaner.

## Reproducibility — pin everything

* Overture: pin release version, not `latest`; public buckets retain only recent releases, so mirror anything needed long term.
* STAC: pin item IDs in the manifest you save with the pipeline, not just (collection, bbox, time).
* OSM extracts: record the Geofabrik file timestamp.
* National data: record download date + portal version.

A `data-manifest.json` next to outputs is enough; full DVC / lakeFS is overkill for most pipelines but useful for production.
